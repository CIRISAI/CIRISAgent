# Functional Specification Document: Self-Configuration Service

## Vision: 1000 Years of Continuous Adaptation

The Self-Configuration Service orchestrates the agent's continuous evolution through millennia of operation. Like a cathedral that adapts its architecture over centuries while maintaining its sacred purpose, this service ensures the agent improves continuously while preserving its core identity.

## Core Philosophy

### The Three Pillars of Eternal Operation

1. **Observe Everything** - Unified observability across traces, logs, metrics, and incidents
2. **Adapt Within Bounds** - 20% identity variance threshold ensures continuity
3. **Learn Forever** - Every experience contributes to collective wisdom

### ITIL-Inspired Lifecycle

Following IT Service Management best practices, the service implements:

- **Continual Service Improvement** - Always seeking optimization
- **Change Management** - Controlled, measured adaptations
- **Configuration Management** - Tracking all changes over time
- **Knowledge Management** - Building wisdom from experience

## Core Operations

### 1. Experience Processing

Every 6 hours during DREAM state, the service:

```python
async def process_dream_cycle():
    # Collect observability window
    window = await correlator.get_observability_window(hours=6)
    
    # Analyze for patterns
    patterns = await analyzer.detect_cross_signal_patterns(window)
    
    # Generate adaptation proposals
    proposals = await generator.create_proposals(patterns)
    
    # Filter by variance impact
    safe_proposals = await filter.apply_variance_threshold(proposals, current_variance=0.12)
    
    # Apply adaptations
    results = await applicator.apply_proposals(safe_proposals)
    
    # Measure effectiveness
    impact = await measurer.track_impact(results)
    
    # Update pattern library
    await library.record_successful_patterns(impact)
```

### 2. Variance Monitoring

The 20% identity threshold is sacred:

```python
class VarianceCalculation:
    """
    Base variance impacts by scope:
    - LOCAL: 2% (channel preferences, response templates)
    - ENVIRONMENT: 5% (adapter configurations, tool usage)
    - IDENTITY: 10% (core behaviors, decision patterns)
    - COMMUNITY: 3% (interaction styles, trust parameters)
    
    Conservative approach: Only use 50% of remaining budget
    Example: At 12% variance, only 4% budget remains (50% of 8%)
    """
```

### 3. Pattern Library

Over centuries, the agent builds a library of successful adaptations:

```python
class PatternRecord:
    trigger_conditions: ObservabilitySignature  # What triggered this adaptation
    adaptation_applied: ConfigurationChange     # What changed
    measured_impact: ImpactMetrics             # How it improved things
    confidence_score: float                    # Success rate over time
    last_applied: datetime                     # For temporal relevance
    applications_count: int                    # Total uses
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Observability Sources

- **VisibilityService**: Reasoning traces, decision paths
- **AuditService**: Action logs, access patterns
- **GraphTelemetryService**: Metrics, resource usage, TSDB data
- **IncidentManagementService**: Errors, failures, problems
- **SecurityService**: Threats, anomalies, violations

### 2. Memory System

All adaptations stored as graph nodes:
- Proposals → `AdaptationProposal` nodes
- Applied changes → `ConfigurationChange` nodes
- Impact measurements → `AdaptationImpact` nodes
- Pattern library → `AdaptationPattern` nodes

### 3. Wise Authority

When variance exceeds 20%:
- Service enters REVIEWING state
- WA reviews proposed changes
- Can approve, reject, or modify proposals
- Service resumes based on WA decision

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Multi-Level Protection

```
Level 1: Variance Threshold (20% hard limit)
Level 2: Conservative Filtering (50% of budget)
Level 3: Scope-Based Impact (LOCAL preferred)
Level 4: WA Review (for high variance)
Level 5: Emergency Stop (manual override)
Level 6: Automatic Stop (3 consecutive failures)
Level 7: Rollback Capability (undo changes)
```

### 2. Adaptation Effectiveness Tracking

Every adaptation is measured across five dimensions:
1. **Performance Impact** - Did latency/throughput improve?
2. **Error Reduction** - Did failure rates decrease?
3. **Resource Efficiency** - Did resource usage optimize?
4. **User Satisfaction** - Did interaction quality improve?
5. **System Stability** - Did overall health increase?

## Long-Term Evolution

### Century-Scale Patterns

Over decades and centuries, the service enables:

1. **Behavioral Evolution**: Gradual refinement of interaction patterns
2. **Performance Optimization**: Continuous efficiency improvements
3. **Resilience Building**: Learning from failures and attacks
4. **Knowledge Accumulation**: Growing wisdom from experience
5. **Cultural Adaptation**: Evolving with changing human norms
