# CIRIS Performance Benchmark Report

**Date**: July 1, 2025  
**Test Environment**: Docker containers with Mock LLM  
**Containers Tested**: Container 6 (port 8086) and Container 8 (port 8088)

## Executive Summary

Performance testing revealed significant response time variability and stability issues under load. The system shows adequate performance for single requests but encounters connection failures when handling multiple concurrent requests.

## Container 6 (Port 8086) - Handler Performance

### Test Configuration
- **Purpose**: Measure individual handler response times
- **Handlers Tested**: SPEAK, RECALL, MEMORIZE
- **Test Size**: 10 requests per handler

### Results

#### SPEAK Handler
- **Success Rate**: 90% (9/10 successful)
- **Average Response Time**: 5.74 seconds
- **Response Time Range**: 4.22s - 8.83s
- **Notable Issues**: 1 timeout after 10 seconds

#### RECALL Handler
- **Success Rate**: 0% (0/10 successful)
- **Failure Mode**: Connection reset errors
- **Impact**: Complete handler failure under test conditions

#### MEMORIZE Handler
- **Success Rate**: 0% (0/10 successful)
- **Failure Mode**: Connection reset errors
- **Impact**: Complete handler failure under test conditions

### Container Health
- Container crashed and restarted during testing
- Health check showed all 7 services healthy after restart
- Uptime reset indicated container instability

## Container 8 (Port 8088) - Throughput Test

### Test Configuration
- **Purpose**: Measure rapid command throughput
- **Test Type**: Sequential rapid commands
- **Test Size**: 5 commands sent as quickly as possible

### Results
- **Success Rate**: 100% (5/5 successful)
- **Total Test Duration**: 29.83 seconds
- **Average Response Time**: 5.965 seconds per command
- **Response Time Range**: 3.33s - 7.67s
- **Throughput**: 0.17 commands/second

### Performance Characteristics
- High variability in response times (3.3s to 7.7s)
- No connection failures with sequential requests
- System maintained stability with controlled load

## Key Findings

### 1. Response Time Analysis
- **Mock LLM Processing**: Average 5-6 seconds per command
- **High Variability**: Response times vary by up to 4.4 seconds
- **Login Performance**: Sub-15ms authentication (excellent)

### 2. Stability Issues
- **Container 6 Instability**: Crashed under moderate load
- **Connection Resets**: RECALL and MEMORIZE handlers failed consistently
- **Recovery**: Containers auto-restart but lose state

### 3. Throughput Limitations
- **Sequential Processing**: 0.17 commands/second maximum
- **Concurrent Failures**: System cannot handle concurrent requests reliably
- **Resource Constraints**: Likely hitting memory or thread limits

## Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Mock LLM Processing Time**: 3-8 seconds per command is the primary bottleneck
2. **Connection Handling**: System fails to maintain connections under load
3. **Memory Management**: Possible memory leaks causing container crashes
4. **Thread Pool Exhaustion**: Connection resets suggest thread pool limits

## Resource Usage Patterns

- Memory usage data unavailable through health endpoint
- Container restarts indicate resource exhaustion
- No CPU metrics available for analysis

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate Connection Handling**: Debug why RECALL/MEMORIZE fail under load
2. **Add Resource Monitoring**: Implement memory/CPU tracking in health endpoint
3. **Increase Timeouts**: Current 10s timeout too short for Mock LLM responses

### Performance Improvements
1. **Optimize Mock LLM**: Reduce processing time from 5-6s to <1s
2. **Connection Pooling**: Implement proper connection pool management
3. **Async Processing**: Enable true async handling for concurrent requests
4. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate container memory/CPU limits

### Testing Improvements
1. **Gradual Load Testing**: Start with 1 concurrent request, increase gradually
2. **Memory Profiling**: Add memory usage tracking during tests
3. **Error Recovery Testing**: Test system behavior after crashes

## Conclusion

The CIRIS system with Mock LLM shows acceptable performance for single-user scenarios but fails under concurrent load. The primary bottleneck is the 5-6 second Mock LLM processing time, compounded by connection handling issues that cause complete handler failures. Container stability is a concern, with crashes occurring under moderate load.

For production deployment, the system would need:
- Significant reduction in LLM processing time
- Improved connection and thread management
- Better resource monitoring and limits
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

Current throughput of 0.17 commands/second would support approximately 10 commands per minute, suitable for low-traffic scenarios but inadequate for production use cases requiring higher throughput.
