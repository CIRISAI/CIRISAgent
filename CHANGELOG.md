## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added
- **‚è∞ System Time Display**: Fixed system snapshot formatter to display "Time of System Snapshot" with UTC, Chicago, and Tokyo times
- **üìã Task Update Tracking**: New 6th conscience check (UpdatedStatusConscience) detects new observations arriving during task processing

    - Added `tasks_by_user` (task count per user)
    - Added `user_id` field to individual task summaries
  - **Double-Protection Filtering**: Two-layer defense for OBSERVER users
    - Layer 1: SQL-level filtering (ACTIVE - filters at database query level using JSON extraction and LIKE patterns)
    - Layer 2: Post-query result filtering (ACTIVE - filters by `created_by`, `user_list`, `task_summaries[].user_id`, `conversations_by_channel[].author_id`)
  - **Protected Endpoints**:
    - `POST /memory/query` - OBSERVER users see only their memories
    - `GET /memory/timeline` - Filtered timeline view
    - `GET /memory/{node_id}` - Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized (not 404)
    - `GET /memory/recall/{node_id}` - Same protection as above
  - **OAuth Integration**: Automatically includes memories from linked Discord/Google accounts
  - **ADMIN Bypass**: ADMIN/AUTHORITY/SYSTEM_ADMIN see all memories without filtering

### Fixed
- **üîê OAuth Account Linking Permissions**: Users can now link/unlink their own OAuth accounts without admin privileges

  - `shutdown_processor.py:338-339,347` - Extract action type from `final_action`
  - Handlers expect `ActionSelectionDMAResult` but were receiving `ConscienceApplicationResult`

  - Resolves AttributeError: 'ConscienceApplicationResult' object has no attribute 'action_parameters'
- **üêõ Graceful Shutdown BrokenPipeError**: Fixed crash during shutdown when stdout is closed

    - Enables full multi-agent awareness in monitored Discord channels

### Added
- **üîê Role-Based Event Filtering**: Secure event filtering for SSE reasoning stream endpoint
