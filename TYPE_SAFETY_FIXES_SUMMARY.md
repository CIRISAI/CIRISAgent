# Type Safety Fixes Summary

## Fixed Tests: test_config_node_fix.py

### Issue
The tests were failing because:
1. They were calling `query_graph({})` with an empty dict instead of a proper `MemoryQuery` object
2. They expected `list_configs()` to return raw values, but it now returns `ConfigValue` objects
3. The test was trying to access `node.key` on a `GraphNode` object, which doesn't have that attribute

### Root Cause
The codebase has been updated to enforce strict type safety:
- No more `Dict[str, Any]` - all data must use Pydantic models
- The config service now properly uses `MemoryQuery` objects instead of dicts
- All config values are wrapped in `ConfigValue` objects for type safety

### Fixes Applied

1. **Added proper imports**:
   - Added `ConfigValue` to imports
   - Added `MemoryQuery` to imports (though not directly used in tests)

2. **Updated test assertions**:
   - Changed from checking `hasattr(value, 'value')` to `isinstance(config_value, ConfigValue)`
   - Updated to access the actual value through `config_value.value`
   - Fixed the malformed node test to properly check for missing keys in results

3. **Config Service Implementation**:
   - The service already converts GraphNodes to ConfigNodes internally
   - Returns `Dict[str, ConfigValue]` from `list_configs()`
   - Properly handles malformed nodes by logging warnings and skipping them

### Type Safety Benefits
These changes ensure:
- All memory queries use the typed `MemoryQuery` schema
- Config values are properly typed through `ConfigValue` wrapper
- Invalid/malformed nodes are gracefully handled without crashes
- The API is more predictable and self-documenting

### Test Results
All 4 tests now pass:
- ✅ test_no_malformed_config_nodes
- ✅ test_config_node_required_fields  
- ✅ test_config_node_error_handling
- ✅ test_filter_service_uses_proper_config
