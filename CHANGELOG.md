## [1.3.5] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- **üí≥ OAuth Billing Integration**: Automatic billing user creation on OAuth login
  - Added `_trigger_billing_credit_check_if_enabled()` helper function in auth.py
  - Triggers billing credit check after successful OAuth login (non-blocking)
  - Ensures billing users are created immediately so frontend can display available credits
  - Works with both `SimpleCreditProvider` (free credits) and `CIRISBillingProvider` (paid credits)
  - OAuth login succeeds even if billing backend is unavailable (fail-safe design)
  - Passes user email and marketing_opt_in to billing context for user creation
- **üåê Environment-Driven OAuth Redirect Configuration**: Flexible OAuth redirect URL management
  - Added `OAUTH_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable for separate frontend/backend domains
  - Added `OAUTH_FRONTEND_PATH` environment variable (default: `/oauth-complete.html`)
  - Added `OAUTH_REDIRECT_PARAMS` environment variable for configurable parameter list
  - Supports Scout architecture: `scout.ciris.ai` frontend + `scoutapi.ciris.ai` backend
  - Maintains backward compatibility with relative path redirects
  - Extracts marketing_opt_in from redirect_uri query parameters
  - Created comprehensive documentation: `docs/OAUTH_REDIRECT_CONFIGURATION.md`

### Fixed
- **üîó OAuth Redirect Query Parameter Preservation**: Fixed redirect_uri stripping existing query params
  - **Root Cause**: `_build_redirect_response` was using `.split("?")[0]` to strip all query params from redirect_uri
  - **Impact**: Frontend routing parameters like `?next=/dashboard` or `?return_to=/profile` were being lost
  - **Solution**: Parse existing query params with urllib.parse, merge with server params (server params override on conflict)
  - **Security**: Server-generated params (access_token, role, etc.) take precedence if there's a naming conflict
  - **Testing**: Added comprehensive test validating preservation of multiple frontend params alongside server params
  - Located at `auth.py:752-763`
- **üêõ OAuth Callback Tests**: Fixed 3 failing tests not updated for new `request` parameter
  - Updated `test_oauth_callback_with_redirect_uri_in_state` to pass mock request
  - Updated `test_oauth_callback_without_redirect_uri_in_state` to pass mock request
  - Updated `test_oauth_callback_malformed_state` to pass mock request
- **üîß Billing Metadata Type**: Fixed boolean to string conversion for CreditContext
  - CreditContext.metadata requires `Dict[str, str]`
  - Updated billing integration to convert `marketing_opt_in` boolean to string

### Testing
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 100% coverage of new features
  - Added 7 new tests in `test_auth_routes_coverage.py::TestBillingIntegration`:
    - `test_trigger_billing_credit_check_enabled_success` - Successful billing check
    - `test_trigger_billing_credit_check_no_resource_monitor` - Graceful no-op when billing disabled
    - `test_trigger_billing_credit_check_no_credit_provider` - Backward compatibility
    - `test_trigger_billing_credit_check_failure_non_blocking` - Non-blocking failure behavior
    - `test_trigger_billing_credit_check_simple_provider` - SimpleCreditProvider compatibility
    - `test_trigger_billing_credit_check_no_email` - Edge case handling
    - `test_oauth_callback_with_billing_integration` - End-to-end integration test
  - Added 1 new test in `test_auth_routes_coverage.py::TestOAuthRedirectURI`:
    - `test_oauth_callback_preserves_redirect_uri_query_params` - Validates query param merging
  - All 10 OAuth redirect tests passing (9 existing + 1 new)
  - All 7 billing integration tests passing
  - Full test suite: 5186 passed, 117 skipped

## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **üéØ Type Safety Migration**: Migrated test mocks from dicts to Pydantic models
  - Updated `test_control_service_bugs.py` to use `SingleStepResult` models instead of dict mocks
  - Updated `test_pipeline_stepping.py` fixture to return `SingleStepResult` with proper field mappings
  - Updated `test_control_service_coverage.py` to use `SingleStepResult` with serialized fields
  - Fixed control service to map `SingleStepResult.message` to error when `success=False`
  - Fixed control service to use internal `thoughts_processed` counter instead of non-existent field
  - Converted `step_results` and `pipeline_state` to dicts using `.model_dump()` for `SerializedModel` compatibility
  - All 60 tests now passing (100% success rate)
- **üîó OAuth Callback URL Construction**: Fixed malformed query parameter URLs
  - Issue: Backend was blindly appending `?access_token=...` even when `redirect_uri` already contained `?`
  - Result: Invalid URLs like `callback?marketing_opt_in=false?access_token=xxx`
  - Fix: Added separator detection to use `&` when `redirect_uri` already has query parameters
  - Now generates valid URLs like `callback?marketing_opt_in=false&access_token=xxx`
  - Located at `auth.py:703-705`
- **üîß Mypy Type Errors**: Resolved 3 type errors causing CI failures
  - `context_utils.py:97` - Added `isinstance(channel_id, str)` check before passing to `create_channel_context()`
  - `recall_handler.py:126` - Added `JSONDict` type annotation for attributes dict
  - `recall_handler.py:167` - Added `JSONDict` type annotation for connected_attrs dict
  - All mypy checks now pass (556 files checked, 0 errors)

### Changed
- **üéØ Control Service Response Mapping**: Enhanced SingleStepResult to ProcessorControlResponse conversion
  - Maps `result.message` to error field when operation fails
  - Uses internal metrics counter for `thoughts_processed` tracking
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing response structure

### Testing

- **‚úÖ QA Tests**: 127/128 tests passing (99.2% success rate)
- **‚úÖ Mypy**: 556 source files, 0 errors (100% type safety)

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **üß™ Test Failures**: Fixed 7 test failures from type-safety improvements
  - Updated `ProcessingRoundResult` and `SingleStepResult` import paths
  - Fixed field name from `thoughts_processed` to `thoughts_advanced`
  - Added required `message` field to `SingleStepResult` instantiations

### Added
- **üîê OAuth Cross-Domain Support**: Enhanced OAuth flow for separate frontend/API domains
  - Added `redirect_uri` parameter support in oauth_login endpoint
  - State parameter now encodes redirect_uri for proper cross-domain redirects
  - Maintains backward compatibility with relative path redirects
  - 8 comprehensive tests for OAuth redirect_uri functionality
- **üìä Multi-Occurrence Architecture**: Infrastructure for multiple API instances
  - Added `occurrence_id` database migration (004_add_occurrence_id.sql)
  - Created telemetry architecture documentation

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- **üîí CRITICAL SECURITY: JWT Rate Limiter Signature Verification**: Fixed JWT tokens being accepted without signature verification in rate limiter
  - **Vulnerability**: Rate limiter was decoding JWT tokens without verifying signatures, allowing attackers to forge tokens with arbitrary user IDs to bypass rate limiting
  - **Root Cause**: `_extract_user_id_from_jwt()` used `jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})` at line 160 of rate_limiter.py
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper JWT signature verification with gateway_secret before trusting token contents
  - **Implementation**: Lazy-load gateway_secret from authentication service via request.app.state, fallback to IP-based rate limiting if verification fails
  - **Impact**: All JWT tokens must now have valid signatures before being used for per-user rate limiting, preventing rate limit bypass attacks
  - **Security Level**: HIGH - CWE privacy vulnerability - JWT signature verification is mandatory for security
- **üìä LLM Call Tracking for Conscience Checks**: Fixed conscience LLM calls not being tracked in telemetry metrics
  - **Root Cause**: All 4 conscience LLM calls (entropy, coherence, optimization_veto, epistemic_humility) were not passing `thought_id` parameter to `call_llm_structured()`
  - **Solution**: Updated all 4 conscience checks in `core.py` to pass `thought_id=context.thought.thought_id` parameter
  - **Impact**: SPEAK thoughts now correctly show 8 LLM calls (4 DMA + 4 conscience) in ACTION_RESULT events, TASK_COMPLETE thoughts correctly show 4 calls (4 DMA, conscience exempt)
  - **Verification**: Telemetry metrics now properly track all LLM calls by `thought_id` tag for accurate resource accounting
- **üîå Together AI Provider Compatibility**: Fixed API errors with Together AI rejecting null values in messages
  - **Root Cause**: Together AI and some other providers reject messages containing null/None values for optional fields (e.g., `name: None`)
  - **Solution**: Added `exclude_none=True` to `model_dump()` for LLMMessage objects and strip None values from dict messages in `llm_bus.py:153-159`
  - **Impact**: LLM calls now work correctly with Together AI provider without 400 errors
  - **Scope**: Applied to both LLMMessage objects and dict messages for consistency across all providers

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **üîÑ Circuit Breaker Recovery**: Fixed critical bug preventing circuit breaker recovery
  - **Root Cause**: `record_failure()` was resetting `last_failure_time` even when circuit breaker was OPEN, preventing 60s recovery timer from elapsing
  - **Solution**: Only update `failure_count` and `last_failure_time` when NOT OPEN, allowing recovery timer to work correctly
  - **Impact**: Circuit breakers now properly transition to HALF_OPEN after 60 seconds, ending infinite retry loops (Echo-Nemesis fix)
- **‚è±Ô∏è LLM Timeout Configuration**: Reduced timeout from 30s to 5s to enable faster failover
  - Configured in OpenAI SDK at provider level (service.py:36, service.py:78)
  - Allows 25 seconds for failover before DMA timeout (30s)
  - Circuit breaker timeout duration also reduced to 5.0s for consistency
  - Recovery timeout standardized to 60.0s across all circuit breakers
- **üìù Enhanced LLM Error Logging**: Added detailed context for debugging LLM failures
  - Schema validation errors: Shows expected schema, validation details, first 500 chars
  - Timeout errors: Reports timeout duration and context
  - Service errors (503): Detailed provider and model information
  - Rate limit errors (429): Enhanced diagnostic context
  - Content filter blocks: Guardrail detection and reporting
  - All errors include: model, provider, CB state, consecutive failures
- **üß† PDMA Ethical Prompt Fix**: Corrected prompt causing schema validation errors
  - Fixed incorrect principle count (4 ‚Üí 6 principles)
  - Changed `alignment_check` from structured dict to single paragraph string
  - Added warning about context red herrings and non sequiturs
  - Eliminated schema validation failures that appeared as "provider issues"
- **üîê Audit Signature Persistence**: Fixed audit entries stored in graph without signatures
  - **Root Cause**: Signatures generated AFTER storing node in graph, never updated
  - **Solution**: Generate hash chain data FIRST, then create node with signature already set
  - Fixed in `log_event()` and `log_action()` - reordered operations
  - Updated `_store_entry_in_graph()` to accept and use hash_chain_data parameter
  - All audit entries now have populated `signature` and `hash_chain` fields in graph_nodes
- **üîí OBSERVER Role Privacy**: Added task information redaction in SSE streaming
  - OBSERVER users now have `recently_completed_tasks_summary` and `top_pending_tasks_summary` redacted from SNAPSHOT_AND_CONTEXT events
  - Redaction applied after channel filtering but before streaming events
  - Uses deep copy to avoid mutating original events
  - ADMIN+ users bypass redaction (see all events unchanged)
  - 7 comprehensive tests cover all edge cases
- **üìä Unified Batch Context Consolidation**: Complete refactoring of system snapshot building (27d5fa28)
  - Consolidated 6 separate code paths into single `BatchContextData` architecture
  - Eliminated redundant database queries and memory service calls
  - Fixed 17 test failures through unified context building
  - All components now use `build_batch_context()` for consistent snapshot data
- **üéØ Code Quality (SonarCloud)**: Resolved 4 critical code quality issues (21fbf325)
  - Removed unnecessary f-string in system_snapshot_helpers.py:938
  - Merged nested if statement in batch_context.py:355
  - Reduced cognitive complexity in gather_context.py (16‚Üí15)
  - Reduced cognitive complexity in system_extensions.py (27‚Üí4 via 4 helper functions)
- **üîë DSDMA Identity Mapping**: Fixed agent stuck in WAKEUP state (210507b8)
  - **Root Cause**: Batch context preserved all identity attributes with `dict(attrs)` but lost critical `role_description` ‚Üí `role` mapping
  - **Solution**: Added explicit field mapping after attribute copy to ensure DSDMA gets required `role` field
  - Fixed: "CRITICAL: role is missing from identity in DSDMA domain 'Datum'!"
- **üë• User Profile Enrichment**: Fixed empty user_profiles in SSE streaming events (12dc43b3)
  - **Root Cause**: JSON serialization failed on datetime objects in connected node attributes during user enrichment
  - **Solution**: Added datetime handler to collect_memorized_attributes for proper serialization
  - Fixed: "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable" error
  - User profiles now populate correctly in all system snapshots and SSE events

### Added
- **Billing & API Keys**: Production billing system integration (billing.ciris.ai)
  - CIRISBillingProvider with API key auth, oauth: prefix handling, idempotency
  - API endpoints: `/api/billing/credits`, `/api/billing/purchase/*`

- **‚è≥ SonarCloud**: CI in progress (4 issues resolved, awaiting new analysis)

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **üî¥ Circuit Breaker State in Telemetry**: Complete circuit breaker tracking across all buses
  - Added `circuit_breaker` field to `TelemetrySummary` schema (`Dict[str, Any]`)
  - New `collect_circuit_breaker_state()` helper walks all buses via `runtime.bus_manager`
  - Collects state from LLM, Memory, Communication, Tool, Wise, and RuntimeControl buses
  - Returns dict mapping service names to `{state, failures, requests, failure_rate, etc}`
  - Visible in SSE `snapshot_and_context` events and telemetry endpoints
  - Empty dict when no circuit breakers triggered (normal operation)
  - Populated with detailed data when failures occur in production
- **‚úÖ QA Circuit Breaker Validation**: Enhanced streaming verification module
  - Added validation to ensure `telemetry_summary.circuit_breaker` exists and is not null
  - Prints circuit_breaker data prominently in verbose test output
  - Test fails if field is missing or null (catches schema regressions)

### Fixed
- **üîÑ LLM Failover**: Secondary LLM services now properly used when primary fails
  - **Root Cause**: `_get_prioritized_services()` was filtering out services with open circuit breakers before failover logic could execute
  - **Solution**: Removed health check from service filtering - circuit breaker check now happens during service selection
  - Services with open circuit breakers are skipped in favor of lower-priority services
  - Removed unused `_is_service_healthy()` method
  - **Impact**: Secondary LLM automatically used when primary circuit breaker opens
  - Expected failure rate drop from 48% to <5% during single-provider outages in production
  - Updated `test_circuit_breaker_skips_to_lower_priority` to verify new behavior
- **üìã Domain Routing Tests**: Updated 2 tests to match new LLM failover behavior
  - `test_domain_filtering_with_unhealthy_services` - Now tests failover when service calls fail (not just health check)
  - `test_service_health_check_failure` ‚Üí `test_service_failure_propagates` - Renamed and updated to test actual call failures
  - Both tests verify correct failover behavior where services are tried in priority order
- **üêõ Code Quality**: Fixed OpenAI timeout configuration and telemetry provider disambiguation
  - OpenAI client timeout was silently ignoring user settings (used `getattr()` instead of direct attribute access)
  - Telemetry aggregator couldn't disambiguate multiple instances of same provider class
  - Both issues fixed with tests to prevent regression
- **üõ°Ô∏è Conscience Exempt Actions**: Added RECALL and OBSERVE to exempt actions list
  - **Before**: Only 3 actions exempt (TASK_COMPLETE, DEFER, REJECT)
  - **After**: 5 actions exempt (RECALL, TASK_COMPLETE, OBSERVE, DEFER, REJECT)
  - Conscience now runs for exactly 5 actions: SPEAK, TOOL, PONDER, MEMORIZE, FORGET
  - Rationale: RECALL/OBSERVE are passive operations with no ethical implications

### Changed

    - Created `ConscienceCheckContext` schema to replace Dict[str, Any] context parameter
    - Updated all 4 conscience types: Entropy, Coherence, OptimizationVeto, EpistemicHumility
    - Message creation methods now return `List[LLMMessage]` instead of `List[Dict[str, str]]`
  - **ProcessorServices**: Extended with `time_service`, `resource_monitor`, `communication_bus` fields

  - Reduces token usage and improves prompt clarity for ethical evaluation
- **üìã System Snapshot Task Filtering**: Fixed `top_pending_tasks_summary` including non-pending tasks
  - `get_top_tasks()` now correctly filters to PENDING status only (was including COMPLETED, DEFERRED, FAILED, REJECTED)
  - System snapshot now accurately represents only actionable pending tasks
  - Aligns with schema field name `top_pending_tasks_summary`

## [1.2.4] - 2025-10-05
