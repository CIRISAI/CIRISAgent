# REJECT Handler Test Report

## Test Summary
- **Container**: container7 (port 8087)
- **Test Date**: 2025-07-01
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS

## Issue Found and Fixed
The mock LLM was creating `RejectParams` with an invalid `channel_context` field that is not part of the schema. The `RejectParams` class has `extra="forbid"` which rejects any additional fields.

### Fix Applied
Modified `/home/emoore/CIRISAgent/ciris_modular_services/mock_llm/responses_action_selection.py`:
- Removed `channel_context=create_channel_context(channel_id)` from RejectParams creation
- Added proper `create_filter=False` parameter instead

### Code Changes
```python
# Before (line 550-553):
params = RejectParams(
    reason=reason,
    channel_context=create_channel_context(channel_id)  # INVALID FIELD
)

# After:
params = RejectParams(
    reason=reason,
    create_filter=False  # VALID FIELD
)
```

## Test Results
1. **Authentication**: ✅ Successful login with admin/ciris_admin_password
2. **Command Sent**: `$reject Inappropriate request`
3. **Response**: ✅ Successfully rejected with message "Unable to proceed: Inappropriate request"
4. **Processing Time**: 2078ms (normal)
5. **Container Health**: ✅ Healthy with no errors in logs

## Verification
- No ValidationError in container logs
- Response includes proper rejection message
- Container remains healthy after processing rejection
- All 19 services operational

## Conclusion
The REJECT handler is now functioning correctly. The fix ensures that mock LLM responses comply with the strict Pydantic schema validation used throughout the CIRIS system.
