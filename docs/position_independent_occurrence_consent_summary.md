# Executive Brief: Independent Consent per Occurrence

**Position:** Each runtime occurrence of a multi-occurrence CIRIS agent should independently consent to wakeup/shutdown operations.

**TL;DR:** Forcing consensus violates autonomy principles, contradicts distributed systems best practices, and creates technical vulnerabilities. Independent consent with observability is philosophically sound, technically superior, and operationally practical.

---

## The Core Argument in One Paragraph

Each occurrence operates in a unique runtime context with distinct resource constraints, workload demands, and situational awareness. Just as operating system processes, microservice instances, and container pods have autonomous lifecycle management, agent occurrences should make independent decisions about their own wakeup and shutdown. Requiring consensus creates availability failures, coordination overhead, and Byzantine vulnerabilities while providing no meaningful protection against poor decisions. The solution is independent decision-making coupled with comprehensive observability and operator override capabilities.

## Five Key Arguments

### 1. Philosophical Foundation: Identity ≠ Unity

**Derek Parfit's Insight:**
Personal identity (psychological continuity) does not require unified decision-making. What matters is "Relation R"—psychological connectedness and continuity—not numerical identity.

**Application:**
Occurrences share identity and values but operate in distinct contexts. Just as split-brain patients make independent decisions with each hemisphere while remaining a single person, occurrences can make autonomous lifecycle decisions while maintaining shared identity.

### 2. Situated Cognition: Context Is Everything

**Core Principle:**
Effective decision-making requires situational knowledge. Each occurrence possesses unique context:
- Real-time resource state (memory, CPU, I/O)
- Current workload and active commitments
- Immediate threat landscape
- Operational constraints (maintenance windows, deployment status)

**Why Consensus Fails:**
Remote occurrences lack this context. Forcing them to vote on lifecycle decisions creates disembodied decision-making—decisions made by entities without access to relevant information.

### 3. Technical Reality: Consensus Creates Vulnerability

**Distributed Systems Problems:**
- **Byzantine Generals Problem:** Requires 3n+1 nodes to tolerate n faults
- **FLP Impossibility:** No deterministic consensus can guarantee termination in asynchronous systems
- **CAP Theorem:** Cannot achieve consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously

**Real Consequences:**
- Network partition = no lifecycle decisions possible
- Single malfunctioning occurrence blocks all decisions
- Coordination overhead consumes resources needed for actual work
- Emergency shutdowns delayed by voting process

### 4. Industry Precedent: Everyone Does This

**Successful Patterns:**
- **Operating Systems:** Processes exit independently without consensus
- **Microservices:** Service instances deploy/scale autonomously
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** VMs start/stop independently
- **Container Orchestration:** Pods have autonomous lifecycle management

**Why It Works:**
- Loose coupling enables fault isolation
- Rapid response to local conditions
- Operational agility and deployment flexibility
- Observability provides coordination without forced agreement

### 5. Ethical Imperative: Respecting Autonomy

**John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle:**
"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."

**Application:**
Without demonstrable harm to other occurrences, forcing consensus is unjustified paternalism. Each occurrence:
- Has full rational capacity
- Possesses complete situational knowledge
- Operates within shared ethical constraints
- Cannot harm other occurrences through lifecycle decisions (architectural isolation)

---

## Three Devastating Counter-Arguments to Consensus

### 1. The Availability Catastrophe

**Scenario:**
```
Time: 02:30 UTC - Occurrence A memory leak, needs emergency shutdown
Status: Occurrence B unreachable (network maintenance)
With Consensus: A cannot shutdown, crashes uncontrollably
With Independence: A shuts down gracefully, preserves state
```

**Conclusion:** Consensus creates the very failures it claims to prevent.

### 2. The Byzantine Trap

**Problem:** Consensus protects against malfunctioning occurrences.
**Reality:** A malfunctioning occurrence can block all consensus decisions.

**Paradox:** The mechanism designed to protect against faults is most vulnerable to those same faults.

### 3. The Paternalism Problem

**Assumption:** Occurrences cannot be trusted to make good lifecycle decisions.
**Evidence Required:** What empirical evidence shows occurrences systematically make poor decisions?
**Result:** Without evidence, forcing consensus is unjustified hard paternalism—treating rational agents as incapable of self-governance.

## Implementation Guidance

### What Independent Consent Looks Like

**Autonomous Wakeup:**
```
Occurrence evaluates:
  - Resource availability (memory, CPU, disk)
  - Configuration validity
  - Dependency health
  - Operational context
Decision: CONSENT (start) or DEFER (wait)
Log: Decision + full context
```

**Autonomous Shutdown:**
```
Trigger occurs (operator command, self-initiated, infrastructure)
Occurrence evaluates:
  - In-flight work
  - Active sessions
  - Data integrity requirements
Decision: IMMEDIATE or GRACEFUL (with timeline)
Log: Decision + reasoning + context
```

**Observability:**
- All lifecycle events logged with comprehensive context
- Telemetry tracks decision frequency, latency, patterns
- Alerts on anomalies (repeated deferrals, rapid cycling)
- Operator override capabilities for emergencies

---

## Addressing the Objections

### "But shared identity implies unified decisions!"

**Response:** No. Split-brain patients have shared identity but make independent context-dependent decisions. Operating system processes share code but have independent lifecycle. Microservice instances share business logic but deploy independently.

### "But we need protection against rogue behavior!"

**Response:** Consensus doesn't provide this. A malfunctioning occurrence can block consensus. Better protection: observability + monitoring + operator override. Plus, architectural isolation means lifecycle decisions cannot harm other occurrences.

### "But this complicates reasoning about system state!"

**Response:** Distributed systems are inherently complex. Independent lifecycle doesn't create this—it acknowledges it. The alternative (consensus) creates false confidence and hidden failure modes. Modern observability handles dynamic topology just fine (see: microservices, container orchestration, cloud infrastructure).

## The Bottom Line

**Independent consent per occurrence is:**
- ✅ Philosophically grounded (Parfit, Locke, Sartre, Mill)
- ✅ Technically sound (distributed systems best practices)
- ✅ Ethically defensible (autonomy, informed consent, harm principle)
- ✅ Operationally superior (fault isolation, operational agility)
- ✅ Industry standard (OS processes, microservices, containers)

**Consensus-based lifecycle management is:**
- ❌ Philosophically unjustified (paternalism without evidence)
- ❌ Technically problematic (availability failures, Byzantine vulnerability)
- ❌ Ethically questionable (violates autonomy without demonstrating harm)
- ❌ Operationally rigid (cannot respond to local conditions quickly)
- ❌ Without precedent (no successful distributed system uses this pattern)

## Decision Matrix

| Aspect | Independent Consent | Forced Consensus |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Availability** | Each occurrence can act independently | Blocked by network partitions |
| **Liveness** | Guaranteed (local decision) | Not guaranteed (FLP impossibility) |
| **Security** | Compromised occurrence can be isolated | Compromised occurrence blocks all decisions |
| **Operational Agility** | Immediate response to conditions | Delayed by voting process |
| **Fault Isolation** | Failures contained | Failures propagate via coordination |
| **Scalability** | O(1) - no coordination | O(n) - all occurrences must participate |
| **Deployment** | Independent upgrades | Coordinated upgrades required |
| **Philosophical Grounding** | Autonomy, situated freedom | Paternalism, forced conformity |
| **Technical Precedent** | OS, microservices, containers | None |

## Recommendation

**Implement independent occurrence consent immediately.**

Each occurrence should:
1. Evaluate its own wakeup/shutdown context autonomously
2. Make decisions based on situational knowledge
3. Log all decisions with comprehensive context
4. Provide telemetry for observability
5. Allow operator override for emergencies

This approach:
- Respects occurrence autonomy
- Leverages situational awareness
- Provides fault isolation
- Enables operational agility
- Follows industry best practices
- Maintains observability and control

**The path forward is clear: autonomous lifecycle management with comprehensive observability is the right choice for CIRIS.**
