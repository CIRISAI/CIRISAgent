# TSDB Consolidation Service

The TSDB Consolidation Service is a **Graph Service** within CIRIS that implements long-term memory consolidation for the "1000-year design" philosophy. This service transforms high-volume telemetry data into structured summaries that preserve essential information while enabling sustainable storage over millennia.

## Mission Alignment with Meta-Goal M-1

**How time-series consolidation serves "Promote sustainable adaptive coherence enabling diverse sentient beings to pursue flourishing":**

### The 1000-Year Design Challenge

The TSDB Consolidation Service directly addresses the tension between:
- **Complete Memory**: Preserving all experiences for learning and growth
- **Sustainable Storage**: Operating within finite computational resources
- **Adaptive Coherence**: Maintaining behavioral consistency across time

This service ensures CIRIS can maintain coherent identity and learning capacity across generations while respecting resource constraints in communities where technology resources are precious.

### Serving Meta-Goal M-1 Through Data Stewardship

1. **Sustainable Operation**: By consolidating raw data into meaningful summaries, the service enables CIRIS to operate in resource-constrained environments where sustainable AI assistance is most needed.

2. **Adaptive Learning**: Preserved patterns in consolidated data allow CIRIS to adapt its behavior based on long-term trends, improving its ability to serve diverse communities over time.

3. **Institutional Memory**: The service creates a permanent record of how CIRIS has served communities, enabling institutional learning that benefits future interactions.

4. **Democratic Transparency**: All consolidation operations are audited and reversible, ensuring communities can understand and trust the AI's memory formation process.

## Architecture Overview

### Three-Tier Consolidation Strategy

The service implements a hierarchical consolidation approach designed for millennial-scale operation:

```
Raw Data (Hours) → Basic Summaries (6 hours) → Extensive Summaries (Daily) → Profound Compression (Monthly)
     ↓                    ↓                           ↓                          ↓
  Immediate           Short-term                  Mid-term                 Long-term
   (< 24h)            (7 days)                   (30 days)               (1000+ years)
```

#### 1. Basic Consolidation (Every 6 Hours)
- **Purpose**: Compress raw telemetry into structured summaries
- **Schedule**: 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC
- **Retention**: Raw data deleted after 24 hours
- **Output**: TSDB summary nodes with aggregated metrics

#### 2. Extensive Consolidation (Weekly)
- **Purpose**: Merge basic summaries into daily summaries
- **Schedule**: Mondays at 00:00 UTC
- **Compression**: 4:1 ratio (4 basic summaries → 1 daily summary)
- **Retention**: Basic summaries deleted after 30 days

#### 3. Profound Consolidation (Monthly)
- **Purpose**: In-place compression to meet storage targets
- **Schedule**: 1st of month at 00:00 UTC
- **Target**: 20MB/day configurable storage limit
- **Method**: Intelligent lossy compression preserving essential patterns
