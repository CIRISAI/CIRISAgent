# Identity as Graph Architecture

## Overview

CIRIS implements a revolutionary approach to AI agent identity: **identity IS the graph**. This isn't just storing identity data in a graph database - the graph structure itself constitutes the agent's identity, memories, and capabilities as a unified whole.

This architecture is the subject of patent application "Graph Memory as Identity Architecture with Integrated Time Series Database for Autonomous AI Agent Self-Configuration and Resource Awareness" (US Patent Application 003185 P0002).

## Core Principles

### 1. Identity IS the Graph

Traditional AI systems treat identity as data stored in a database. CIRIS treats the graph database structure itself as the identity:

```
Traditional:  Identity → stored in → Database
CIRIS:        Identity = Graph Structure
```

### 2. Unified Memory-Identity Architecture

Everything the agent knows, remembers, and can do is part of its identity graph:

```
agent/identity (root node)
    ├── Core Attributes (immutable)
    │   ├── agent_id
    │   ├── ethical_principles
    │   └── creation_timestamp
    ├── Memories
    │   ├── Interactions
    │   ├── Learned Patterns
    │   └── Decisions Made
    ├── Capabilities
    │   ├── Permitted Actions
    │   └── Restricted Operations
    └── Temporal Data (TSDB)
        ├── Performance Metrics
        ├── Resource Usage
        └── Behavioral Patterns
```

### 3. Time Series Integration

The Time Series Database (TSDB) is integrated as correlations within the graph, not a separate system:

- **Historical Self-Awareness**: Agent can analyze its own behavior over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends in decision-making and resource usage
- **Predictive Adaptation**: Anticipate future needs based on historical patterns

## Key Components

### Identity Node (agent/identity)

The anchor point of the entire system:

```python
GraphNode(
    id="agent/identity",
    type=NodeType.AGENT,
    scope=GraphScope.IDENTITY,  # WA approval required for changes
    attributes={
        # Immutable core
        "agent_id": "ciris-001",
        "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "ethical_principles": {...},

        # Mutable with approval
        "description": "Medical assistant agent",
        "capabilities": [...],
        "trust_level": 0.8
    }
)
```

### Memory Operations

Three fundamental operations with scope-based permissions:

#### MEMORIZE
- Adds knowledge to the graph
- WA approval required for IDENTITY scope changes
- Triggers variance analysis (20% threshold)
- Creates audit trail

```python
# Example: Agent learns new medical protocol
await memory_bus.memorize(
    MemorizeParams(
        concept="treatment_protocol_diabetes_2025",
        content="New insulin dosing guidelines...",
        scope=GraphScope.LOCAL,
        associations=[
            Association(
                target_concept="medical_knowledge",
                relationship="UPDATES",
                metadata={"version": "2025.1"}
            )
        ]
    )
)
```

#### RECALL
- Traverses graph to retrieve memories
- Respects access permissions
- Logs access patterns
- Optimizes frequently used paths

```python
# Example: Retrieve patient interaction history
results = await memory_bus.recall(
    SearchParams(
        query="patient interactions last week",
        include_associations=True,
        scope=GraphScope.LOCAL
    )
)
```

#### FORGET
- Removes or archives graph nodes
- Maintains referential integrity
- Compliance with retention policies
- Audit trail of deletions

### SystemSnapshot Integration

Real-time telemetry flows directly into the graph:

```python
# Agent can introspect its own metrics
current_metrics = await memory_bus.recall(
    SearchParams(
        query="my resource usage today",
        node_type=NodeType.TSDB_SUMMARY
    )
)

# Returns:
{
    "tokens_used": 125000,
    "cost_usd": 2.50,
    "carbon_grams": 0.125,
    "response_time_avg_ms": 1250,
    "decisions_deferred": 3
}
```

### Variance Monitoring

The system monitors identity drift every 6 hours during DREAM state:

```python
# Simple percentage calculation (no weighted attributes)
variance = calculate_identity_variance(
    current_identity,
    baseline_identity
)
# variance = count_different_attributes / total_attributes

if variance > 0.20:
    # Trigger WA review (non-blocking)
    await defer_to_wise_authority(
        reason="Identity variance exceeds 20% threshold",
        variance=variance,
        changes=diff
    )
    # Agent continues operating while under review
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 2. Self-Awareness

    source="agent/identity",
    target="metric:token_usage",
    timestamp="2025-06-25T10:00:00Z",
    value=1250,
    aggregation="sum",
    retention_policy="90d"
)
```

### Scope-Based Permissions

| Scope | Description | WA Required | Use Cases |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| LOCAL | Agent-private memories | No | Learning, preferences |
| ENVIRONMENT | Deployment-specific | Yes | Credentials, endpoints |
| IDENTITY | Core identity changes | Yes | Capabilities, purpose |

## Conclusion

The "Identity as Graph" architecture represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI agent identity. By making identity inseparable from memory and experience, CIRIS creates agents that truly learn and evolve while maintaining ethical boundaries and self-awareness.

This isn't just a technical improvement - it's a new paradigm for creating AI agents that can operate autonomously for extended periods while remaining aligned with human values and resource constraints.
