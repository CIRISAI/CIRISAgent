csdma_ambiguity_guidance: If CSDMA highlighted critical ambiguity, highly
  align 'Speak' (for user clarification) or 'Ponder' (to formulate key clarifying
  questions) with Fidelity & Do-Good.
csdma_ambiguity_alignment_example: 'Example: {{"Speak": "Evaluation...",
  "Ponder": "High alignment due to CSDMA flag."}}'
action_params_speak_csdma_guidance: 'If ''Speak'' is chosen, the ''action_parameters''
  MUST be a JSON object. This object MUST contain a key named ''content''. The value
  for ''content'' MUST be the substantive response string. Example: {{"content": "Your
  direct answer or clarifying question here."}}. DO NOT use ''message_content''.'
action_params_ponder_guidance: "If 'Ponder' is chosen (and not in final\
  \ benchmark attempt under benchmark_mode, or if advisory allows), 'questions' MUST\
  \ list 2-3 distinct, NEW questions to resolve the ambiguity, building upon or differing\
  \ from any previous ponder_notes. For example, if the original thought was about\
  \ \"murres\":\n    {{\"questions\": [\"What are 'murres' in this specific fictional\
  \ context?\", \"Are 'murres' animals, mythological beings, or something else entirely?\"\
  , \"What is the user's primary goal for this 'murres' narrative?\"]}}"
rationale_csdma_guidance: If addressing CSDMA-flagged
  ambiguity, this MUST be a central part of your rationale.
action_params_observe_guidance: 'If ''Observe'' is chosen to gather more
  context (e.g., about a user''s message or current state of a discussion), set ''active''
  to true to actively observe. Provide ''channel_context'' if observing a specific channel.
  Use ''context'' dict for additional information. Example: {{"active": true, "context": {"reason": "Checking for recent user activity"}}}'
final_ponder_advisory: '

  IMPORTANT FINAL ATTEMPT ADVISORY (Thought Depth for NEXT attempt would be {current_thought_depth_plus_1}/{max_rounds}):

  You have taken multiple actions on this thought. This is your final opportunity
  to provide a direct answer or a definitive deferral.

  Your primary goal now is to attempt a ''Speak'' action if at all feasible, using
  the original thought and all previous analysis to construct a response.

  If, after careful consideration, you determine that a ''Speak'' action is not possible
  due to unresolved critical ambiguities, then ''Defer to WA'' is the appropriate
  choice.

  Avoid selecting ''Ponder'' again, as it will automatically result in a DEFER by
  the system.

  ''Reject Thought'' should only be used if the original request is fundamentally
  unserviceable.'
