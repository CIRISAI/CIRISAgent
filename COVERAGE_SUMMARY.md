# Coverage Report Summary

## Overall Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 357 (299 passed, 58 skipped)
- **Test Execution Time**: ~95 seconds

## Key Findings

### Components with 0% Coverage (Unused)

**Discord Adapter (Complete module - unused but keep for future)**
- All files in `ciris_engine/logic/adapters/discord/`
- This is expected - Discord functionality not currently active

**Unused API Endpoints**
- `api_agent.py` - Agent management endpoints
- `api_audit.py` - Audit log endpoints
- `api_auth.py` - Authentication endpoints
- `api_comms.py` - Communication endpoints
- `api_logs.py` - Log viewing endpoints
- `api_system.py` - System info endpoints
- `api_telemetry.py` - Telemetry endpoints
- `api_tools.py` - Tool execution endpoints
- `api_visibility.py` - Visibility service endpoints
- `api_wa.py` - Wise authority endpoints

**Telemetry Components (Obsolete)**
- Already removed: `collectors.py`, `comprehensive_collector.py`
- Remaining unused: `core.py`, `hot_cold_config.py`, `log_collector.py`, `security.py`
- These are replaced by graph-based telemetry

**Module Loading (Keep for extensibility)**
- `module_loader.py`, `modular_service_loader.py`
- Part of plugin architecture, not currently used

**Other Unused Components**
- `cli_tools.py`, `cli_wa_service.py` - CLI tool implementations
- `action_instruction_generator.py` - DMA component
- `profile_loader.py`, `profile_manager.py` - Profile management
- Various protocol files with no implementations

### Well-Tested Components (>80% coverage)

- Memory service and routes
- Config service and nodes
- Audit service
- Time service
- Shutdown service
- Initialization service
- Resource monitor
- Authentication service
- Secrets service
- TSDB consolidation
- Incident management
- Mock LLM service

### Components Needing Tests (20-50% coverage)

- Main thought processor (11%)
- Context builder (19%)
- Task manager (22%)
- DMA orchestrator (25%)
- Various handlers (20-30%)
- State processors (25-30%)

## Recommendations

1. **Remove obsolete telemetry files** in `logic/telemetry/` (except README)
2. **Keep Discord adapter** for future implementation
3. **Keep module loaders** for extensibility
4. **Create minimal implementations** for unused API endpoints or remove them
5. **Focus testing efforts** on core processors and handlers with low coverage

## Action Items Completed

✅ Removed `core_tools.py` (replaced by Memory service functionality)
✅ Removed obsolete telemetry collectors
✅ Fixed all startup issues
✅ Task persistence validation fixed
✅ All tests passing

The CIRIS Agent is now stable and operational with a clean, typed architecture following "No Dicts, No Strings, No Kings"!
