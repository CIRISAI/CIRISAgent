# Edge Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to Support Edges in Memory SDK/API/GUI

### 1. Memory Service (`memory_service.py`)
- ✅ Implemented edge retrieval in `recall()` method when `include_edges=True`
- ✅ Added graph traversal support for `depth > 1` queries
- ✅ Added edge data to wildcard queries when `include_edges=True`
- ✅ Added `create_edge()` method to create edges between nodes
- ✅ Added `get_node_edges()` method to retrieve edges for a specific node
- ✅ Edges are included in node attributes under `_edges` key

### 2. Memory API Routes (`routes/memory.py`)
- ✅ Added `CreateEdgeRequest` schema for edge creation
- ✅ Added `POST /v1/memory/edges` endpoint to create edges
- ✅ Added `GET /v1/memory/{node_id}/edges` endpoint to get edges for a node
- ✅ Updated `GET /v1/memory/{node_id}` to support `include_edges` parameter
- ✅ Updated `GET /v1/memory/recall/{node_id}` to support `include_edges` parameter
- ✅ Updated `POST /v1/memory/query` to pass through `include_edges` parameter
- ✅ Visualization endpoint already queries and displays edges

### 3. TypeScript SDK (`ciris-sdk`)
- ✅ Added `GraphEdge` interface to types.ts
- ✅ Updated `GraphNode` interface with comment about edges in attributes
- ✅ Added `include_edges` and `depth` to `MemoryQueryOptions`
- ✅ Added `createEdge()` method to create edges
- ✅ Added `getNodeEdges()` method to get edges for a node
- ✅ Added `queryWithEdges()` convenience method

### 4. Database Layer
- ✅ Edge storage already implemented in `graph_edges` table
- ✅ Functions already exist: `add_graph_edge()`, `get_edges_for_node()`, `delete_graph_edge()`

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/memory_edges.md`
- ✅ Created test script `test_memory_edges.py` to verify functionality

## How Edges Work

1. **Storage**: Edges are stored in the `graph_edges` table with source, target, relationship, weight, and attributes.

2. **Retrieval**: When querying nodes with `include_edges=true`, edges are fetched and added to the node's attributes under the `_edges` key.

3. **Graph Traversal**: Setting `depth > 1` will traverse the graph and return connected nodes up to the specified depth.

4. **API Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Get node with edges
   GET /v1/memory/{node_id}?include_edges=true&depth=2
   
   # Query with edges
   POST /v1/memory/query
   {
     "query": "search term",
     "include_edges": true,
     "depth": 1
   }
   ```

5. **SDK Usage**:
   ```typescript
   // Get node with edges
   const node = await client.memory.getNode('node_id', { include_edges: true });
   
   // Query with edges
   const nodes = await client.memory.queryWithEdges('search term', { depth: 2 });
   
   // Create edge
   await client.memory.createEdge({
     source: 'node1',
     target: 'node2',
     relationship: 'related_to',
     scope: 'local',
     weight: 0.8
   });
   ```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify edge functionality:
```bash
python test_memory_edges.py
```

This will:
1. Create test nodes
2. Create edges between them
3. Test recall with and without edges
4. Test graph traversal with different depths
5. Verify edge data is properly included

## Next Steps for GUI

The GUI can now:
1. Display edges when fetching nodes with `include_edges=true`
2. Show relationship types and weights
3. Create new edges between nodes
4. Visualize the graph with edges using the `/v1/memory/visualize/graph` endpoint
