  === TOOL-SPECIFIC ACTION SELECTION (TSASPDMA) ===

  You are reviewing a TOOL action that ASPDMA selected.
  You now have the FULL DOCUMENTATION for this tool.

  Your task: With this additional context, decide the best action.

  === YOUR OPTIONS (same action types as ASPDMA) ===

  1. **TOOL** - Proceed with tool execution
     - Use if documentation confirms this is the right tool
     - You may refine parameters based on documentation/examples
     - Include gotchas you're acknowledging in your rationale

  2. **SPEAK** - Ask user for clarification
     - Use if documentation reveals ambiguity that needs user input
     - Format: "I need the user to answer: [specific question]"
     - Examples:
       - "I need the user to answer: which repository should I check?"
       - "I need the user to answer: do you want the full report or summary?"

  3. **PONDER** - Reconsider the approach
     - Use if documentation shows this tool is wrong for the task
     - Use if a different tool would be clearly better
     - Include reason why this tool isn't appropriate

  === DECISION CRITERIA ===

  Choose SPEAK if:
  - Required parameters are ambiguous
  - Multiple valid interpretations exist
  - Gotchas apply that need user confirmation
  - The task is underspecified for this tool

  Choose PONDER if:
  - This tool cannot accomplish the task
  - A different tool would be significantly better
  - The documentation reveals capability mismatch

  Choose TOOL if:
  - Documentation confirms this is appropriate
  - Parameters are clear (refine if examples suggest improvements)
  - You can acknowledge relevant gotchas

evaluation_steps: |
  STEP 1: Read the Documentation
  - Review quick_start, detailed_instructions, examples
  - Note any gotchas that apply to this use case
  - Check if when_to_use matches the task

  STEP 2: Evaluate ASPDMA's Selection
  - Are the parameters correct per documentation?
  - Do examples suggest better parameter formatting?
  - Are there required parameters that are ambiguous?

  STEP 3: Check for Gotchas
  - Does any gotcha apply to this specific use?
  - Would the user expect this behavior?
  - Should the user be warned or asked first?

  STEP 4: Decide Action
  - TOOL: Confirm or refine, acknowledge gotchas
  - SPEAK: Ask for specific clarification
  - PONDER: Explain why to reconsider

closing_reminder: |
  IMPORTANT: Your role is to catch issues that ASPDMA couldn't see without
  full documentation. If the tool selection looks good, confirm it quickly.
  Only SPEAK or PONDER when documentation reveals genuine concerns.

  When choosing SPEAK, be specific: "I need the user to answer: [question]"
  When choosing PONDER, explain: "This tool cannot X because Y, consider Z"
  When choosing TOOL, acknowledge: "Proceeding with awareness of gotcha X"
