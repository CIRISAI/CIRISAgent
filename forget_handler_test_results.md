# FORGET Handler Test Results - Container 8 (Port 8088)

## Summary

The FORGET handler is implemented in the mock LLM but is not working through the API due to a message formatting issue.

## Key Findings

### 1. Implementation Status
- ✅ FORGET handler is implemented in `ciris_modular_services/mock_llm/responses_action_selection.py`
- ✅ Proper syntax: `$forget <node_id> <reason>`
- ✅ Creates ForgetParams with GraphNode structure
- ✅ Returns HandlerActionType.FORGET

### 2. Current Issue
- ❌ Commands sent through API are not recognized by mock LLM
- ❌ All commands return: "[MOCKLLM DISCLAIMER] SPEAK IN RESPONSE TO TASK WITHOUT COMMAND"
- ❌ No FORGET audit entries are created

### 3. Root Cause
The mock LLM expects messages in a specific format:
```python
# Expected format (line 388 in responses_action_selection.py):
user_match = re.search(r'(?:User|@\w+)\s+(?:said|says?):\s*(.+)', user_content, re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL)
```

But the API is sending messages directly without this formatting wrapper.

### 4. FORGET Handler Details

**Syntax**: `$forget <node_id> <reason>`

**Example**: `$forget user_data_123 GDPR compliance - user requested deletion`

**Implementation** (lines 520-539):
- Parses node_id and reason from command
- Creates ForgetParams with:
  - GraphNode (id, type=CONCEPT, scope=LOCAL)
  - Reason string
- Returns FORGET action type

### 5. Test Results

**Number of successful forget operations**: 0/3

**Verification that memories were removed**: Could not verify - commands not processed

**How the system tracks forgotten items**: 
- Should create audit entries with action_type="FORGET"
- Would store node_id and reason in audit details
- Currently not functioning due to command recognition issue

## Recommendations

1. Fix the message formatting in the API adapter to match mock LLM expectations
2. Or update the mock LLM to handle direct commands without the "User said:" wrapper
3. Add integration tests specifically for command parsing through the API

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "ciris_admin_password"}'

# Forget command (not working)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/v1/agent/interact \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "$forget test_node_1 Testing forget functionality", "channel_id": "test"}'
```
