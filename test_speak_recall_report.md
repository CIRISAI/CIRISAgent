# SPEAK and RECALL Handler Test Report

## Test Summary

Tested SPEAK and RECALL handlers on containers 0 and 1 with the following results:

### Container 0 (Port 8080) - SPEAK Handler

**Test 1: $speak Testing SPEAK handler on container 0**
- ✅ **SUCCESS**: SPEAK handler correctly returned the spoken text
- Response time: ~4.27s
- The spoken text appears at the beginning of the response
- Full response includes conversation history

**Test 2: Regular message "What is CIRIS?"**
- ✅ Works as expected, returns default mock response
- Response time: ~6.30s

### Container 1 (Port 8081) - RECALL Handler

**Test 1: $recall memories**
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**: Command processed but returns default mock response
- Response time: ~1.56s
- No actual recall functionality triggered
- Returns: "[MOCKLLM DISCLAIMER] SPEAK IN RESPONSE TO TASK WITHOUT COMMAND"

**Test 2: $recall test data**
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**: Same as above
- Response time: ~4.34s
- Returns default mock response

## Technical Analysis

### SPEAK Handler
The SPEAK handler is working correctly after fixing the mock LLM code. It:
1. Properly parses the `$speak` command
2. Extracts the text parameter
3. Returns a SpeakParams object with the content
4. The API correctly processes this and returns the spoken text

### RECALL Handler
The RECALL handler has been partially fixed:
1. ✅ Fixed RecallParams schema mismatch (was using old `node` parameter, now uses `query`, `node_id`, etc.)
2. ⚠️ The mock LLM processes the command but returns default response instead of triggering recall
3. The actual recall handler would create a follow-up thought with memory query results

## Code Changes Made

Fixed in `/home/emoore/CIRISAgent/ciris_modular_services/mock_llm/responses_action_selection.py`:
- Updated RecallParams construction to use new schema fields (`query`, `node_id`, `node_type`, `scope`)
- Removed old GraphNode-based parameter passing
- Added support for both query-based and node-id-based recall

## Issues Identified

1. **Container 0 Timeout**: Some recall requests timeout after 30 seconds on container 0
2. **Mock Response**: RECALL commands return generic mock response instead of simulating memory retrieval
3. **Validation Errors**: Initial tests showed Pydantic validation errors due to schema mismatch (now fixed)

## Recommendations

1. The mock LLM should be enhanced to simulate memory recall responses
2. Add specific mock responses for RECALL actions that return sample memory data
3. Consider adding integration tests that verify the full flow from command to response

## Response Times Summary

- SPEAK on Container 0: 4-6 seconds
- RECALL on Container 1: 1.5-4 seconds (returns mock response)
- RECALL on Container 0: 30+ seconds (timeout issues)

## Conclusion

SPEAK handler is fully functional and returns the actual spoken text as expected. RECALL handler accepts commands with the correct parameters but doesn't simulate actual memory retrieval in the mock LLM. The core fix for RecallParams schema compatibility has been successfully implemented.
