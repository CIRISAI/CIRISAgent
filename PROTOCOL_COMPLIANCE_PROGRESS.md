# Protocol Compliance Progress Report

## Current Status: 85% Complete

### ‚úÖ Completed High Priority Items

1. **MemoryService Protocol Alignment**
   - Created `MemoryQuery` schema
   - Fixed `recall()` method signature
   - Added identity/environment update methods to protocol
   - Updated handler and bus implementations

2. **TelemetryService Disambiguation**
   - Renamed `TelemetryService` ‚Üí `BasicTelemetryCollector`
   - Created `ProtocolCompliantTelemetryService`
   - Resolved naming conflicts

3. **TSDBSignedAuditService Compliance**
   - Now inherits from `AuditService` protocol
   - Added missing `log_guardrail_event()` and `get_audit_trail()` methods

4. **Adapter Method Visibility**
   - Made Discord-specific methods internal (`_send_output`, `_on_message`, `_client`)
   - Identified that `attach_to_client` and `get_home_channel_id` are adapter-specific

5. **WiseAuthorityService Type Safety**
   - Created `GuidanceContext` and `DeferralContext` schemas
   - Updated protocol to use typed schemas instead of `Dict[str, Any]`
   - Updated `WiseBus` and `DeferHandler` to use new schemas

### üöß In Progress

1. **WiseAuthority Implementation Updates**
   - Need to update CLI and Discord implementations to use new typed signatures
   - ~10 implementation files need updating

### ‚ùå Remaining High Priority

1. **Handler Protocol Usage Validation**
   - Verify all action handlers use only protocol methods
   - No direct service instantiation

2. **BusManager Route Verification**
   - Ensure all bus routes match protocol capabilities exactly

3. **Schema Consistency**
   - Verify all schemas in protocols match foundational schemas

4. **RuntimeControl Protocol**
   - Check if protocol exposes all runtime capabilities

5. **SecretsService Protocol**
   - Validate coverage of encryption/filter/store operations

### üìä Metrics

- **MyPy Errors**: 41 (increased due to protocol changes)
- **Protocol Violations Fixed**: 7 major issues
- **Schemas Created**: 3 (`MemoryQuery`, `GuidanceContext`, `DeferralContext`)
- **Services Aligned**: 5 of 7 core services

### üéØ Path to 100%

1. Complete WiseAuthority implementation updates (~2 hours)
2. Fix remaining MyPy errors from protocol changes (~1 hour)
3. Validate handler protocol usage (~1 hour)
4. Create automated protocol compliance tests (~2 hours)
5. Final verification with mypy toolkit (~30 minutes)

**Estimated Time to 100%**: 6-7 hours of focused work

### üí° Key Insights

1. **No Dicts Policy**: Found several protocol violations where `Dict[str, Any]` was used
2. **Hidden Capabilities**: Many services had public methods not exposed in protocols
3. **Type Mismatches**: Several protocol/implementation signature mismatches
4. **Naming Conflicts**: Service classes with same names as protocols caused confusion

The codebase is becoming significantly more robust with each fix. The trinity pattern (Protocol-Module-Schema) is proving effective at exposing design flaws.
