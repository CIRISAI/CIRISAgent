## üéØ Mission Alignment with Meta-Goal M-1

The Shutdown Service serves **Meta-Goal M-1** (Promote sustainable adaptive coherence enabling diverse sentient beings to pursue flourishing) through:

### Data Integrity & Coherence Preservation
- **Graceful Shutdown Coordination**: Ensures all active processes complete or reach safe checkpoints before system termination
- **Handler Orchestration**: Allows services to register cleanup handlers that preserve data consistency
- **Multi-phase Shutdown**: Synchronous handlers execute immediately, async handlers get timeout-protected execution
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Prevents race conditions during shutdown that could corrupt system state

### Sustainable Operations
- **Emergency Kill Switch**: Provides WA-authorized emergency shutdown with Ed25519 signature verification
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents hung processes from blocking system recovery (5-second emergency timeout)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with legacy shutdown_manager utilities
- **Resource Cleanup**: Enables proper resource deallocation and connection cleanup

### Adaptive Coherence
- **Status Transparency**: Exposes shutdown state through telemetry and metrics
- **Audit Integration**: All shutdown events are logged for system learning and improvement
- **Flexible Triggering**: Supports both graceful shutdown requests and emergency commands
- **Service Coordination**: Works with other infrastructure services to maintain system coherence

## üîß Core Functionality

### 1. Graceful Shutdown Management

**Primary Method**: `request_shutdown(reason: str) -> None`
- Coordinates system-wide shutdown with registered handlers
- Thread-safe operation prevents duplicate shutdown requests
- Executes all registered synchronous handlers immediately
- Sets shutdown event for async waiting patterns

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Shutdown request flow:
1. Check if already requested (thread-safe)
2. Set shutdown flags and reason
3. Update metrics counters
4. Signal shutdown event
5. Execute all sync handlers with error handling
```

### 2. Handler Registration System

**Synchronous Handlers**: `register_shutdown_handler(handler: Callable[[], None]) -> None`
- Immediate execution during shutdown request
- Used for critical cleanup operations
- Error handling prevents handler failures from blocking shutdown

**Asynchronous Handlers**: `_register_async_shutdown_handler(handler)` (internal)
- Executed during emergency shutdown with timeout protection
- Used for non-blocking I/O operations during cleanup
- Protected by timeout to prevent hung operations

### 3. Emergency Shutdown Protocol

**Method**: `emergency_shutdown(reason: str, timeout_seconds: int = 5) -> None`
- WA-authorized emergency termination with minimal cleanup
- Executes sync handlers first (quick operations)
- Executes async handlers with timeout protection
- Force-kills process after timeout using SIGKILL
- Metrics tracking for emergency vs graceful shutdowns

**Security Features**:
- Ed25519 signature verification (via schemas)
- WA authority chain validation
- Command expiration checking
- Audit logging of all emergency commands

### 4. State Management & Monitoring

**State Tracking**:
- `is_shutdown_requested() -> bool`
- `get_shutdown_reason() -> Optional[str]`
- Thread-safe access to shutdown state
- Integration with service health checks

**Waiting Patterns**:
- `wait_for_shutdown()` - Blocking wait
- `wait_for_shutdown_async()` - Async wait with event
- Used by runtime loops for graceful termination

## üìä Metrics & Telemetry

### Standard Service Metrics
- `service_uptime_seconds`: Time since service start
- `service_health`: Current health status (0/1)
- `registered_handlers`: Number of registered shutdown handlers
- `shutdown_requested`: Whether shutdown has been requested (0/1)
- `emergency_mode`: Whether in emergency shutdown mode (0/1)

### v1.4.3 Shutdown-Specific Metrics
- `shutdown_requests_total`: Total shutdown requests received
- `shutdown_graceful_total`: Number of graceful shutdowns
- `shutdown_emergency_total`: Number of emergency shutdowns
- `shutdown_uptime_seconds`: Service uptime (for trending analysis)

### Integration Points
- **Telemetry Service**: All metrics flow through graph-based telemetry
- **Audit Service**: Shutdown events logged for compliance
- **Resource Monitor**: Tracks shutdown handler execution times

## üîê Security & Emergency Features

### WA-Authorized Emergency Shutdown

The service integrates with CIRIS emergency command system:

**Schema Classes** (`ciris_engine/schemas/services/shutdown.py`):
- `WASignedCommand`: Ed25519-signed emergency commands
- `EmergencyShutdownStatus`: Tracking emergency shutdown progress
- `KillSwitchConfig`: Configuration for emergency shutdown behavior

**Command Types**:
- `SHUTDOWN_NOW`: Immediate forced termination
- `FREEZE`: Stop processing but maintain state
- `SAFE_MODE`: Minimal functionality only

**Security Chain**:
1. WA public key verification
2. Signature validation using Ed25519
3. Command expiration checking
4. Trust tree depth validation
5. Audit logging of all commands

### Force Kill Protection
- 5-second timeout for emergency shutdown
- Process self-termination using SIGKILL
- Safety checks prevent killing wrong processes
- Fallback to SIGTERM if SIGKILL fails

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes & Conversion Requirements

### Required Module Conversion

**Current Structure**: Single file (`shutdown.py`)
**Required Structure**: Module directory

```
lifecycle/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shutdown/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service.py         # Main ShutdownService class
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers.py        # Handler management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ emergency.py       # Emergency shutdown logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metrics.py         # Metrics collection
```

### Data Integrity Mission

The Shutdown Service is **critical** for Meta-Goal M-1 because:

1. **Prevents Data Corruption**: Ensures all active transactions complete or rollback safely
2. **Maintains Coherence**: Coordinated shutdown prevents race conditions between services  
3. **Enables Recovery**: Proper shutdown state allows clean restart with intact system coherence
4. **Audit Trail**: All shutdown events are logged for system learning and compliance

### Production Considerations

**Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead (~1MB with handlers)
**Performance**: Sub-millisecond shutdown request processing
**Reliability**: 100% test pass rate with comprehensive edge case coverage
**Security**: Ed25519 signature verification for emergency commands
