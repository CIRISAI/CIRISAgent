However, missing persistent, tamper-evident telemetry and limited historical aggregation weaken long-term learning and governance. Lack of public-facing PDMA/WBD exposure and fairness instrumentation also restricts the ecosystem\u2019s ability to adaptively self-correct. Net effect: moderate support for M-1 with clear avenues to strengthen adaptive feedback loops and accountability.",

The DISCORD_ADAPTER provides solid operational transparency and governance hooks (WBD, audit integration) that advance adaptive coherence and safety, but it underdelivers on persistent auditability, user autonomy/consent, fairness instrumentation, and built-in content safety.

Risks remain: correlation records can include request parameters and channel identifiers and are stored with a default 'raw' retention and unspecified TTL, creating potential for privacy leaks or data misuse; statistics reset on restart, impeding post-incident forensics; limited historical aggregation and single-session support increase operational fragility; and interactive-mode dependencies can fail without strong fallback handling.
