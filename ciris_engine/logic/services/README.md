# CIRIS Services

The 22 core services that implement CIRIS's mission-driven architecture. Each service serves a specific purpose aligned with Meta-Goal M-1: promoting sustainable adaptive coherence enabling diverse sentient beings to pursue flourishing.

## Service Architecture Overview

CIRIS follows a strict service architecture with exactly **22 core services** organized into 6 categories:

### [Graph Services (6)](#graph-services) - Memory and Data Management
Services that manage different aspects of the graph memory system and data persistence.

### [Infrastructure Services (4)](#infrastructure-services) - Foundation Systems  
Core infrastructure services that enable reliable system operation.

### [Lifecycle Services (4)](#lifecycle-services) - System Lifecycle Management
Services that manage system initialization, operation, and shutdown.

### [Governance Services (5)](#governance-services) - Ethical and Operational Governance
Services that ensure ethical behavior and operational transparency.

### [Runtime Services (2)](#runtime-services) - Essential Runtime Operations
Critical services for system operation and external integrations.

### [Tool Services (1)](#tool-services) - Agent Self-Help Capabilities
Services that provide tools for agent self-sufficiency.

## Service Architecture Patterns

### Base Service Classes

- **`BaseService`** - Common service interface and lifecycle management
- **`BaseGraphService`** - Graph-integrated services with memory capabilities  
- **`BaseInfrastructureService`** - Infrastructure services with system integration
- **`BaseScheduledService`** - Services with time-based scheduling capabilities

### Service Dependencies

Services follow strict dependency order during initialization:

1. **Infrastructure** (time, shutdown, init, resources)
2. **Database** (SQLite with migrations)  
3. **Memory Foundation** (secrets, memory service)
4. **Identity** (load/create agent identity)
5. **Graph Services** (config, audit, telemetry, etc.)
6. **Security** (wise authority)
7. **Remaining Services**
8. **Tool Services**
9. **Component Assembly**
10. **Final Verification**

### Message Bus vs Direct Injection

**Services Using Message Buses:**
- Memory Service (MemoryBus) - Multiple graph backends
- LLM Service (LLMBus) - Multiple LLM providers  
- Wise Authority Service (WiseBus) - Distributed wisdom
- Secrets Tool Service (ToolBus) - Tool ecosystem
- Runtime Control Service (RuntimeControlBus) - Management interfaces

**Services Using Direct Injection:**
- All Graph Services (except memory)
- All Infrastructure Services  
- All Lifecycle Services
- All remaining Governance Services

### Service Principles

1. **Mission Alignment** - Every service justifies existence against Meta-Goal M-1
2. **Single Responsibility** - Each service has one clear purpose
3. **Protocol-First** - All services implement defined protocols
4. **Type Safety** - Zero `Dict[str, Any]` in service implementations
5. **Async-First** - All services support async operations
6. **Offline Capable** - Services work without external dependencies
7. **Audit Everything** - All service operations are traceable

## Development Guidelines

### Adding a New Service

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The 22-service architecture is complete. New services should only be added with explicit architectural justification.

1. Define protocol in `ciris_engine/protocols/services/`
2. Implement service extending appropriate base class
3. Create schemas in `ciris_engine/schemas/services/`
4. Add to ServiceInitializer dependency order
5. Update service count documentation (if approved)
6. Add comprehensive tests
7. Document service purpose and mission alignment

### Service Testing

- Integration over unit tests
- Real schemas, no dict mocks
- Test through protocols, not implementations
- Async test patterns throughout
- Offline scenario coverage
