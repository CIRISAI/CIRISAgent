# CIRIS Agent Implementation Task List

## Document Status
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: ACTIVE WORK PLAN  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-05

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, prioritized task list for completing the CIRIS Agent pre-beta implementation. Tasks are organized by component and include clear success criteria, testing requirements, and integration points.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è AGENT-IN-THE-LOOP TYPE SAFETY & COMPLIANCE

CIRIS Agents are responsible for:
- Enforcing strict type safety and protocol/schema compliance across the codebase
- Using the CIRIS MyPy Toolkit to analyze, review, and execute type and protocol/schema fixes
- Ensuring no code is left in comments, no dead code remains, and all type annotations are protocol/schema-bound
- Reviewing all proposed fixes before execution (no auto-application without agent approval)
- Driving the codebase to zero mypy errors and full compliance

### CIRIS MyPy Toolkit Agent Workflow
1. **Analyze**: Run the toolkit to collect and categorize all mypy, protocol, and schema errors.
2. **Review**: Review the proposed fixes (in JSON or report form) and approve or edit as needed.
3. **Execute**: Apply only the approved fixes, then re-analyze to confirm compliance.

**Key Principles:**
- Only types from `protocols/` and `schemas/` are allowed in type annotations.
- All dead code and commented code is purged automatically.
- No ambiguous or partial fixes are allowed‚Äîevery change must be protocol/schema-compliant.
- All changes are reviewable and auditable by agents.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WORKING PRINCIPLES

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write unit tests BEFORE implementing features
2. **Type Safety**: All code must be properly typed with comprehensive error handling
3. **Security First**: Assume hostile environment, implement defense-in-depth
4. **Fail Secure**: Any failure must default to safe operation
5. **Humble Assessment**: Only mark tasks complete when fully tested and integrated

## REPOSITORY GUIDELINES (Original Content)

- All unit tests are currently passing. Ensure they remain green by running
  `pytest -q` before committing changes.
- Prefer asynchronous functions when dealing with I/O or long-running tasks. Use `asyncio.to_thread` for blocking calls.
- Keep new scripts and services minimal and well-documented.
- All handler logic now lives under `ciris_engine/action_handlers`. The old
  `memory/` and `ponder/` packages were removed. When adding new handlers use the
  service registry via `BaseActionHandler.get_*_service()` for communication,
  memory, and other services. See `registries/README.md` for details on the
  registry and fallback behavior.
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (or a local equivalent) before running tests.

- Action handlers must follow the standard BaseActionHandler pattern. Each handler defines `action_type` and implements `handle(thought, params, dispatch_context) -> bool`.
- Replace any direct service usage (e.g. discord_service.send_message) with registry lookups like `get_communication_service()`.

- Validate handler parameters using Pydantic models. If `params` is a dict, cast it to the proper `*Params` model before using it.
- Do not compare action names with string literals. Use the `HandlerActionType` enums instead.

- Configure logging using `ciris_engine.utils.logging_config.setup_basic_logging`
  and access the application configuration with
  `ciris_engine.config.config_manager.get_config()`.

- After the setup script completes, the environment is locked down: only
  packages listed in `requirements.txt` are available. Add new dependencies to
  that file and move on if you face issues testing

- Each submodule under `ciris_engine/` should include a brief `README.md`
  describing its purpose and how to use it. Add one if it doesn't exist when
  modifying a module.

- Use `python main.py --help` to see the unified runtime options. The same flags
  map directly to runtime arguments (e.g., `--host`, `--port`, `--no-interactive`).
  For offline tests pass `--mock-llm` to avoid calling external APIs.

## NOTES FOR CLAUDE

When working through this task list:

1. **Always start with tests** - Write comprehensive unit tests before implementing features
2. **Be thorough** - Don't mark tasks complete until fully tested and integrated
3. **Update progress** - Keep this document updated with current status
4. **Security focus** - All security-critical components need extra testing
5. **Performance validation** - Measure impact of all changes
6. **Integration testing** - Ensure new features don't break existing functionality

Remember: This is mission-critical software. Quality and security are more important than speed.

## ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES

- All implementation details can be found in the top-level `README.md` and each module's `README.md`. Refer to those documents for background, usage, and architectural notes.
- The development environment has full internet access. Use online resources if needed.
- When running or testing the system, **always** use the mock LLM service (`--mock-llm`). Extend the mock implementation when debugging issues rather than calling external APIs.
- Every code change must be mission critical and completely typed. No legacy accommodation or backward compatibility should be introduced.
- Guardrails and sinks currently have less than 40% test coverage. Prioritize tests to bring these modules to acceptable levels.
