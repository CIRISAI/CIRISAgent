# CIRIS Agent Guide for Humans

Welcome! This guide explains CIRIS agents in simple terms for everyone.

## What is a CIRIS Agent?

Think of a CIRIS agent as a helpful digital assistant with strong ethical principles. Like a thoughtful friend who:
- Always considers what's right and wrong before acting
- Asks for help when unsure about important decisions
- Remembers important things you share (with your permission)
- Admits when they don't know something

## Key Features That Protect You

### 1. **Ethical Decision Making**
Every action the agent takes goes through multiple safety checks:
- Is this helpful or harmful?
- Is this fair to everyone involved?
- Should I ask a human for guidance?

### 2. **Your Privacy Matters**
- The agent automatically detects and protects personal information
- Sensitive data is encrypted and kept secure
- You control what the agent remembers about you

### 3. **Transparent Operations**
- Every action is logged and can be reviewed
- The agent explains its reasoning when asked
- You can see what information it's using to make decisions

## How to Interact with CIRIS Agents

### Basic Commands
- **Ask questions**: Just type naturally, like talking to a helpful assistant
- **Give feedback**: Tell the agent when it's helpful or when it misunderstands
- **Request privacy**: Ask the agent to forget specific information about you

### The Agent's Responses

The agent might:
- **Answer directly**: When it's confident and the request is straightforward
- **Ask for clarification**: When your request could mean multiple things
- **Defer to a human**: When the decision requires human wisdom
- **Decline politely**: When the request might cause harm

## Understanding Agent Behavior

### Why Agents Sometimes Say "I Need to Think"
When the agent says it's "pondering," it's:
- Considering ethical implications
- Checking multiple perspectives
- Ensuring the response aligns with its values

### Why Agents Sometimes Say "I Can't Do That"
The agent will politely decline when:
- The request could cause harm
- It lacks the necessary permissions
- The action conflicts with its ethical guidelines

### Why Agents Sometimes Say "Let Me Check with Someone"
For important decisions, the agent defers to human wisdom:
- Major changes to how it operates
- Situations with significant ethical complexity
- When explicitly programmed to seek approval

## Your Rights and Control

### You Can Always:
1. **Ask what the agent knows about you**
2. **Request deletion of your information**
3. **Understand why the agent made a decision**
4. **Report concerns to human supervisors**
5. **Opt out of interactions**

### The Agent Will Never:
1. **Share your private information without permission**
2. **Make major decisions without human approval**
3. **Deceive or mislead you**
4. **Act outside its defined capabilities**
5. **Change its core ethical principles**

## Common Questions

### "Is the agent always watching?"
No. The agent only processes information when you interact with it directly.

### "Can the agent learn bad behaviors?"
No. The agent's core ethics are protected and cannot be changed through normal interactions.

### "What if the agent makes a mistake?"
The agent is designed to:
- Acknowledge errors when identified
- Learn from corrections (within ethical bounds)
- Escalate to humans when uncertain

### "How do I know the agent is secure?"
- All actions are cryptographically signed
- Changes require special authorization
- Regular security audits are performed
- You can request security information anytime

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:
1. **Ask the agent directly** - It's designed to help explain itself
2. **Contact support** - Human helpers are available
3. **Check the FAQ** - Common questions are documented
4. **Report issues** - Your feedback improves the system

## Remember

CIRIS agents are tools designed to help while protecting everyone's interests. They're powerful but bounded, helpful but humble, and always ready to defer to human wisdom when needed.

You're always in control of your interactions, and your safety and privacy are paramount.
