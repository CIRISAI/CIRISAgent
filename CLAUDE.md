# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

CIRIS is a moral reasoning platform designed for progressive deployment:
- **Current Production**: Discord community moderation (handling spam, fostering positive community)
- **Architecture Goals**: Resource-constrained environments (4GB RAM, offline-capable)
- **Target Deployments**: Rural clinics, educational settings, community centers
- **Design Philosophy**: Start simple (Discord bot), scale to critical (healthcare triage)

The sophisticated architecture (19 services, 6 buses) is intentional - it's a platform that starts as a Discord bot but is designed to scale to mission-critical applications in resource-constrained environments.

## Core Philosophy: No Dicts, No Strings, No Kings

The CIRIS codebase follows strict typing principles:

- **No Dicts**: âœ… ACHIEVED! Zero `Dict[str, Any]` in production code. All data uses Pydantic models/schemas.
- **No Strings**: Avoid magic strings. Use enums, typed constants, and schema fields instead.
- **No Kings**: No special cases or bypass patterns. Every component follows the same typed, validated patterns.
- **No Backwards Compatibility**: The codebase moves forward only. No legacy support code.

This ensures type safety, validation, and clear contracts throughout the system.

## Current Status (June 29, 2025)

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Achievements

1. **Complete Type Safety**
   - Zero `Dict[str, Any]` in production code
   - All data structures use Pydantic schemas
   - Full type validation throughout the system

2. **Service Architecture**: Exactly 19 services
   - Graph Services (6): memory, audit, config, telemetry, incident_management, tsdb_consolidation
   - Core Services (2): llm, secrets
   - Infrastructure Services (7): time, shutdown, initialization, visibility, authentication, resource_monitor, runtime_control
   - Governance Services (1): wise_authority
   - Special Services (3): self_configuration, adaptive_filter, task_scheduler

3. **API v1.0**: Fully Operational
   - All 35 endpoints implemented and tested
   - 100% test pass rate (34/34 endpoints)
   - Role-based access control (OBSERVER/ADMIN/AUTHORITY/SYSTEM_ADMIN)
   - Emergency shutdown with Ed25519 signatures
   - Default dev credentials: admin/ciris_admin_password
   - WebSocket support for real-time streaming

4. **Typed Graph Node System**
   - 11 active TypedGraphNode classes with full validation
   - Automatic type registration via node registry
   - Clean serialization pattern with to_graph_node()/from_graph_node()
   - All nodes include required metadata fields

5. **Graph-Based Telemetry**
   - All telemetry flows through memory graph
   - Real-time metrics via memorize_metric()
   - 6-hour consolidation for long-term storage
   - Full resource tracking with model-specific pricing

6. **Clean Architecture**
   - Protocol-first design with clear interfaces
   - Services separated by concern
   - No circular dependencies
   - All logic under `logic/` directory

## Architecture Overview

### Message Bus Architecture (6 Buses)

Buses enable multiple providers for scalability:

**Bussed Services**:
- CommunicationBus â†’ Multiple adapters (Discord, API, CLI)
- MemoryBus â†’ Multiple graph backends (Neo4j, ArangoDB, in-memory)
- LLMBus â†’ Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- ToolBus â†’ Multiple tool providers from adapters
- RuntimeControlBus â†’ Multiple control interfaces
- WiseBus â†’ Multiple wisdom sources

**Direct Call Services**:
- All Graph Services (except memory)
- Core Services: secrets
- Infrastructure Services (except wise_authority)
- All Special Services

### Service Registry Usage

Only for multi-provider services:
1. **LLM** - Multiple providers
2. **Memory** - Multiple graph backends
3. **WiseAuthority** - Multiple wisdom sources
4. **RuntimeControl** - Adapter-provided only

### Cognitive States (6)
- **WAKEUP** - Identity confirmation
- **WORK** - Normal task processing
- **PLAY** - Creative mode
- **SOLITUDE** - Reflection
- **DREAM** - Deep introspection
- **SHUTDOWN** - Graceful termination

## Development

### Running the Agent
```bash
# Docker deployment (API mode)
docker-compose -f docker-compose-api-mock.yml up -d

# CLI mode with mock LLM
python main.py --mock-llm --timeout 15 --adapter cli
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Run API tests
python test_api_v1_comprehensive.py
```

### API Authentication
```python
# Default development credentials
username = "root"
password = "ciris_root_password"
```

## Key Principles

1. **Service Count is Sacred**: Exactly 19 services
2. **No Service Creates Services**: Only ServiceInitializer creates services
3. **Type Safety First**: All data uses Pydantic schemas
4. **Protocol-Driven**: All services implement clear protocols
5. **Forward Only**: No backwards compatibility

## Why This Architecture?

- **SQLite + Threading**: Offline-first for remote deployments
- **19 Services**: Modular for selective deployment
- **Graph Memory**: Builds local knowledge base
- **Mock LLM**: Critical for offline operation
- **Resource Constraints**: Designed for 4GB RAM environments
