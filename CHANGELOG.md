## [1.1.2] - 2025-09-10

### Major Achievements
- **üéØ Massive Cognitive Complexity Reduction**: Reduced SonarCloud complexity from 400+ to ‚â§15 across 7+ critical functions
- **üîí Complete Type Safety Migration**: Eliminated Dict[str, Any] usage across core systems with proper Pydantic schemas
- **üßπ Comprehensive Code Quality**: Integrated Vulture unused code detection and cleaned up 50+ dead code issues
- **üîß H3ERE Pipeline Enhancement**: Added typed step results streaming and fixed pipeline test infrastructure

### Fixed
- **H3ERE pipeline streaming test** - Resolved missing gather_context step issue by aligning streaming test expectations with actual system behavior (simple interactions use direct handler processing rather than full H3ERE pipeline)
- **Typed step results infrastructure** - Fixed step result data structure preservation in SSE streaming to maintain proper type information
- **OAuth WA duplicate user records** - OAuth users minted as Wise Authorities no longer create separate user records, maintaining single record integrity
- **Missing telemetry endpoints** - Added missing @router.post decorator for query_telemetry endpoint and missing fields to TelemetryQueryFilters schema
- **LLM service type safety** - Updated LLM service and tests for proper ExtractedJSONData schema usage
- **Code maintainability issues** - Removed unused parameters, duplicate imports, orphaned code, and indentation errors across multiple modules

### Changed
- **üèóÔ∏è Telemetry Routes Architecture** - Completely refactored telemetry routes reducing complexity from 400+ to ~15:
  - `get_reasoning_traces` (137‚Üí15) - Extracted 8 helper functions
  - `query_telemetry` (38‚Üí15) - Extracted 6 query type handlers  
  - `get_otlp_telemetry` (104‚Üí15) - Extracted 6 OTLP export helpers
  - `get_detailed_metrics` (82‚Üí15) - Extracted 5 metric processing helpers
- **üîß Audit Service Refactoring** - Reduced complexity from 20‚Üí15 with 6 extracted helper functions for ID extraction and processing
- **üíæ Type Safety Migration** - Replaced Dict[str, Any] with proper typed schemas across:
  - Pipeline control protocols
  - LLM service schemas  
  - Audit service operations
  - Telemetry data structures
  - API route handlers
- **BaseObserver behavior** - Changed to create ACTIVE tasks with STANDARD thoughts for H3ERE pipeline consistency
- **Streaming verification test** - Updated success criteria to validate actual streaming functionality

### Added
- **üîç Vulture Integration** - Comprehensive unused code detection with CI pipeline integration:
  - Added pyproject.toml with Vulture configuration
  - Created whitelist for legitimate unused code patterns
  - Automated dead code detection in CI/CD pipeline
- **üìä Typed Step Results** - Enhanced reasoning stream with strongly typed step result population
- **üêõ Enhanced Debug Infrastructure** - Comprehensive tracing for step result creation and H3ERE pipeline execution flow  
- **üß™ Test Coverage Expansion** - Added comprehensive test coverage for OAuth WA fixes and LLM service improvements
- **‚öôÔ∏è QA Runner Enhancement** - Enhanced test runner with debug log support for better troubleshooting

### Removed
- **Dead Code Cleanup** - Systematic removal of unused imports, unreachable code, and unimplemented parameters:
  - Removed duplicate UTC_TIMEZONE_SUFFIX constant
  - Cleaned up unused Union imports from typing
  - Eliminated orphaned code blocks
  - Removed unused function parameters across multiple modules

## [1.1.1] - 2025-09-09

### Fixed
- **Emergency shutdown force termination** - Emergency shutdown endpoint now calls `emergency_shutdown()` instead of `request_shutdown()` for proper SIGKILL termination
- **ThoughtDepthGuardrail DEFER mechanism** - Fixed guardrail not returning DEFER actions to conscience, enabling proper action chain depth limiting
- **OAuth WA minting duplicate records** - OAuth users minted as Wise Authorities no longer create separate user records, maintaining single record integrity
- **Server lifecycle corruption bug** - Long-running API servers no longer accumulate state corruption causing test timeouts

### Security
- **Weak crypto hashing vulnerabilities** - Address CodeQL vulnerabilities #29 and #31 with proper SHA256 hash handling and API key generation

### Added
- **Comprehensive QA test suite** - 125 test cases across 15 modules with 100% success rate validation
- **Dead code cleanup automation** - Systematic removal of unused imports, unreachable code, and unimplemented parameters via Vulture analysis
- **Enhanced test coverage** - Authentication routes coverage increased from 23.63% to 40.07% (+16.44%)

### Changed
- **Cognitive complexity reduction** - Reduced complexity below SonarCloud threshold (15) for 4 critical functions in auth.py, audit.py, and agent.py routes
- **Code maintainability improvements** - Removed 8 high-confidence dead code issues, improving overall code quality

### Removed
- **Unused code cleanup** - Removed unused imports, unreachable code statements, and unimplemented function parameters across core engine modules
