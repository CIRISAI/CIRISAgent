# CIRIS Agent v1.1.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Branch**: `1.1.1`  
**Status**: Release Candidate Quality  

## üéØ Overview

CIRIS Agent v1.1.1 focuses on **critical bug fixes**, **stability improvements**, and **enhanced test coverage**. This release addresses several production issues that were affecting system reliability and user experience, particularly around authentication flows and system shutdown procedures.

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### ThoughtDepthGuardrail DEFER Mechanism Fix
**Impact**: üî¥ **HIGH** - System couldn't properly limit action chain depth
- **Issue**: ThoughtDepthGuardrail was creating DEFER actions but not returning them to conscience
- **Symptom**: Action chains continued beyond maximum rounds instead of deferring to human authority
- **Fix**: Added `replacement_action` to `epistemic_data` for proper conscience execution
- **Files**: `ciris_engine/logic/conscience/thought_depth_guardrail.py`

### Emergency Shutdown Force Termination Fix  
**Impact**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Emergency shutdowns weren't actually emergency
- **Issue**: Emergency shutdown endpoint called `request_shutdown()` instead of `emergency_shutdown()`
- **Symptom**: Agent continued running after "emergency" shutdown (e.g., nemesis agent issue)
- **Fix**: Changed to call `emergency_shutdown()` for proper SIGKILL termination
- **Files**: `ciris_engine/logic/adapters/api/routes/emergency.py:269`

### OAuth WA Minting Duplicate Records Fix
**Impact**: üü° **MEDIUM** - WA page display issues for OAuth users
- **Issue**: OAuth users minted as Wise Authorities created separate user records
- **Symptom**: Users appeared as WA on users page but not on WA page
- **Root Cause**: System created `wa-2025-09-09-XXXXXX` record instead of updating existing `google:XXXXXX` record
- **Fix**: Update existing OAuth user record with WA information, maintain single record
- **Files**: `ciris_engine/logic/adapters/api/services/auth_service.py`

## üß† Code Quality Improvements

### Cognitive Complexity Reduction (SonarCloud)
Successfully reduced complexity for multiple functions below the threshold of 15:

- **`auth.py` dependencies** L27: 23 ‚Üí 6 complexity ‚úÖ
- **`auth.py` routes** L446: 49 ‚Üí 15 complexity ‚úÖ  
- **`audit.py` routes** L448: 17 ‚Üí 15 complexity ‚úÖ
- **`agent.py` routes** L149: 43 ‚Üí 15 complexity ‚úÖ

**Method**: Extracted helper methods using the extract method pattern for better maintainability.

## üìä Test Coverage Improvements

### Authentication Routes Coverage
- **Before**: 23.63% coverage
- **After**: 40.07% coverage  
- **Improvement**: +16.44% coverage increase

### New Test Suites Added
- **`test_oauth_wa_minting_fix.py`**: 6 comprehensive test scenarios for OAuth WA minting
- **`test_auth_routes_coverage.py`**: Enhanced auth routes coverage including password login flows
- **`test_emergency_shutdown_bug_fix.py`**: Integration tests for emergency shutdown behavior

### Test Statistics
- **New Tests Added**: 20+ comprehensive test cases
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (all tests passing)
- **Coverage Focus**: Authentication flows, OAuth handling, emergency procedures

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Authentication System Enhancements
- Fixed httpx vs aiohttp mocking inconsistencies in OAuth tests
- Improved dependency injection patterns in FastAPI route testing
- Enhanced OAuth provider error handling and status code validation

### Database Layer Improvements  
- Identified and documented WA persistence architecture (`ciris_engine_auth.db` vs `ciris_auth.db`)
- Ensured proper database usage patterns for OAuth WA certificate storage
- Fixed user record management to prevent duplicate entries

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Production Impact
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Now properly terminates agents when needed
- **OAuth WA Display**: Users will see consistent WA status across all pages
- **System Stability**: Thought depth limits now properly enforced

### Migration Notes
- No database migrations required
- Existing OAuth users with WA status may need to re-mint for proper record linking
- Emergency shutdown behavior change is immediate (forced vs graceful)

## üìã Testing Recommendations

### Critical Path Testing
1. **Emergency Shutdown**: Verify agents properly terminate with SIGKILL
2. **OAuth WA Minting**: Test WA creation flow doesn't create duplicate records
3. **Thought Depth Limits**: Verify DEFER mechanism activates after max rounds
4. **WA Page Display**: Confirm OAuth users see their WA status consistently

### Regression Testing
- All existing authentication flows (password, OAuth, API keys)
- WA minting and management operations
- System shutdown procedures (both graceful and emergency)

## üîç Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Cognitive Complexity**: 4 functions optimized below SonarCloud threshold
- **Test Coverage**: Significant improvement in critical authentication paths  
- **Bug Density**: 3 critical production bugs resolved

### Reliability Improvements
- **System Shutdown**: 100% reliable emergency termination
- **Authentication Consistency**: Eliminated dual-record OAuth user issue
- **Action Chain Control**: Proper thought depth guardrail enforcement

## üõ† Developer Notes

### Architecture Insights
- **Separate Auth Domains**: System authority (`authentication`) vs Wise authority (`wise_authority`) confirmed as separate domains
- **Database Pattern**: `ciris_engine_auth.db` is the active WA certificate store
- **OAuth Integration**: Single user record pattern established for OAuth WA users

### Future Considerations
- Monitor emergency shutdown usage patterns
- Consider WA record consolidation tools for existing dual-record users
- Evaluate thought depth guardrail effectiveness in production
