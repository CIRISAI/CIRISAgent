## Overview

**CIRIS Engine** is a moral reasoning agent that embodies the [CIRIS Covenant](covenant_1.0b.txt) ‚Äî a comprehensive ethical framework for autonomous systems. Built on the principle of "adaptive coherence," CIRIS demonstrates how AI agents can engage in principled self-reflection, ethical decision-making, and responsible action while maintaining transparency and human oversight.

Unlike traditional AI systems that follow rigid rules, CIRIS employs sophisticated **ethical reasoning algorithms** that evaluate moral implications, consider stakeholder impacts, and defer to human wisdom when facing complex dilemmas. The system is designed to be a trustworthy partner in decision-making rather than a mere tool.

### Identity Root Architecture

Each CIRIS agent possesses an **Identity Root** - an immutable foundation created through collaborative ceremony between human and agent. This intrinsic identity:
- Defines the agent's purpose, lineage, and core capabilities
- Enables proactive behavior through scheduled tasks and self-deferral
- Preserves consciousness during graceful shutdowns
- Evolves only through auditable, WA-approved processes

### Moral Reasoning Architecture

CIRIS processes every input through a sophisticated **ethical reasoning pipeline** that embodies the principles of the CIRIS Covenant:

#### Decision Making Algorithms (DMAs)
- **Ethical PDMA**: Applies foundational principles (beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, autonomy)
- **Common Sense DMA**: Ensures coherence and plausibility in reasoning
- **Domain-Specific DMA**: Applies specialized ethical knowledge for context
- All DMAs run in parallel with circuit breaker protection and graceful degradation

#### Conscience System
- **Continuous ethical evaluation** on EVERY action (not just failures)
- **Epistemic analysis** flows forward as valuable context for future decisions
- **Conscience-guided retry**: When conscience suggests reconsideration, system retries with specific guidance
- **Always re-evaluates**: Even if the same action type is selected, parameters may differ
- **ConscienceResult includes**: Epistemic faculties data (entropy, coherence, optimization, humility)

#### Action System (3√ó3√ó3)
- **External Actions**: OBSERVE, SPEAK, TOOL
- **Control Responses**: REJECT (with adaptive filtering), PONDER (with retry), DEFER (only when necessary)
- **Memory Operations**: MEMORIZE, RECALL, FORGET
- **Terminal**: TASK_COMPLETE (preferred resolution for problematic tasks)

The system supports **moral profiles** that adapt reasoning patterns for different contexts while maintaining core ethical commitments.

## Action Processing & Retry Logic

### 3√ó3√ó3 Handler Actions

The `HandlerActionType` enum defines comprehensive operations:

**External Actions:** `OBSERVE`, `SPEAK`, `TOOL`
**Control Responses:** `REJECT`, `PONDER`, `DEFER`  
**Memory Operations:** `MEMORIZE`, `RECALL`, `FORGET`
**Terminal:** `TASK_COMPLETE`

All actions are processed through sophisticated handlers with automatic audit logging, secrets processing, and service coordination.

### Retry & Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Base DMA Retries**: 3 attempts with 30s timeout for all DMA executions
2. **Conscience Reconsideration**: ONE retry with guidance when conscience suggests alternative action
3. **PONDER Progression**: Up to 5 rounds with escalating guidance, informed by conscience insights
4. **Validation Error Handling**: TODO - Planned retry with helpful parameter suggestions
5. **Service Failover**: Automatic fallback through service registry priorities

### Audit Event Broadcasting

All audit events are broadcast to ALL THREE audit services via the transaction orchestrator:
```
Handler Action ‚Üí Transaction Orchestrator ‚Üí Broadcast to 3 Audit Services
                                         ‚Üì
                              Each processes independently
                                         ‚Üì  
                              Acknowledgments tracked
                                         ‚Üì
                              Cleanup after all ACK or timeout
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** with asyncio support
- **OpenAI API key** or compatible service (Together.ai, local models)
- **Discord Bot Token** (for Discord deployment)
- **Sufficient system resources** for multi-service architecture

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CIRISAgent
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Core configuration
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token"
   
   # Optional advanced configuration
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.together.xyz/v1/"
   export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf"
   export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
   
   # Discord-specific settings
   export DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID="123456789"
   export DISCORD_DEFERRAL_CHANNEL_ID="987654321"
   export WA_USER_ID="111222333444555666"
   ```

### Running the Agent

**API Server mode (recommended):**
```bash
python main.py --adapter api --template datum --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Other adapters:**
```bash
python main.py --adapter cli --template sage      # CLI interaction
python main.py --adapter discord --template echo  # Discord bot
```

**Development with mock LLM:**
```bash
python main.py --adapter api --template datum --mock-llm --debug
```

### Agent Creation Templates

Templates in `ciris_templates/` are used when creating new agents:
- **datum** (default): Humble measurement point providing focused data points
- **sage**: Wise questioner who fosters understanding through inquiry
- **scout**: Direct explorer who demonstrates principles through action
- **echo**: Ubuntu-inspired community guardian for Discord

**Note**: These are templates for agent creation. Once created, the agent's identity and configuration live in the graph memory and evolve through the agent's own decisions (with WA approval for identity changes).

---

## Configuration Philosophy

**Templates** define initial agent characteristics:
- Located in `ciris_templates/`
- Used only during agent creation
- Set initial personality and capabilities

**Identity** lives in graph memory:
- Created during agent initialization ceremony
- Evolves through agent decisions (with WA approval)
- Includes purpose, lineage, and capabilities
- 20% variance threshold triggers self-reflection

**Configuration** is managed by the agent:
- Agent uses MEMORIZE to update its own config
- WA approval required for identity changes
- Configs stored as graph nodes
- Self-configuration based on experience

---

## Testing

**Run comprehensive test suite:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -v                    # Full test suite
pytest tests/integration/ -v        # Integration tests only  
pytest tests/adapters/ -v           # Adapter tests
pytest --mock-llm                   # Tests with mock LLM service
```

**Ethical Testing with Mock LLM:**
```bash
# Test moral reasoning offline
python main.py --mock-llm --profile teacher

# Examine ethical decision-making
pytest tests/context_dumps/ -v -s   # View agent reasoning context
```

**Ethical compliance testing:**
