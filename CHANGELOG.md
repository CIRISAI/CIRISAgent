## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **IDMA (Intuition Decision Making Algorithm)** - Semantic implementation of Coherence Collapse Analysis (CCA)
  - Applies k_eff formula: `k_eff = k / (1 + ρ(k-1))` to evaluate source independence
  - Phase classification: chaos (contradictory) / healthy (diverse) / rigidity (echo chamber)
  - Fragility detection when k_eff < 2 OR phase = "rigidity"
  - Integrated as 4th DMA in pipeline, runs after PDMA/CSDMA/DSDMA
  - Results passed to ASPDMA for action selection context
  - Non-fatal: pipeline continues with warning if IDMA fails

- **Covenant v1.2-Beta** - Added Book IX: The Mathematics of Coherence
  - The Coherence Ratchet mathematical framework for agents
  - CCA principles for detecting correlation-driven failure modes
  - Rationale document explaining why agents have access to this knowledge
  - Updated constants to reference new covenant file

- **Coherence Ratchet Trace Capture** - Full 6-component reasoning trace for corpus building
  - Captures: situation_analysis, ethical_pdma, csdma, action_selection, conscience_check, guardrails
  - Cryptographic signing of complete traces for immutability
  - Mock logshipper endpoint for testing trace collection
  - Transparency API endpoints for trace retrieval (`/v1/transparency/traces/latest`)

- **OpenRouter Provider Routing** - Select/ignore specific LLM backends
  - Environment variables: `OPENROUTER_PROVIDER_ORDER`, `OPENROUTER_IGNORE_PROVIDERS`
  - Provider config passed via `extra_body` to Instructor
  - Success logging: `[OPENROUTER] SUCCESS - Provider: {name}`

- **System/Error Message Visibility** - Messages visible to all users via system channel
  - System and error messages emitted to agent history
  - `is_agent=True` on system/error messages prevents agent self-observation
  - System channel included in all user channel queries

### Changed

- **LLM Bus Retry Logic** - 3 retries per service before failover
  - Configurable retry count with exponential backoff
  - Log deduplication for repeated failures (WARNING instead of ERROR)
  - Circuit breaker integration with retry exhaustion

- **Changelog Rotation** - Archived 2025 changelog
  - `CHANGELOG-2025.md` contains v1.1.1 through v1.7.9
  - Fresh `CHANGELOG.md` for 2026

### Fixed

- **ServiceRegistry Lookup for Modular Adapters** - Transparency routes now query ServiceRegistry
  - Modular adapters register with ServiceRegistry, not runtime.adapters
  - Fixed trace API returning 404/500 for covenant_metrics traces

- **Streaming Verification Test** - Added `action_parameters` to expected fields
  - ActionResultEvent schema includes action_parameters but test validation was missing it
  - QA runner streaming tests now pass with full schema validation
