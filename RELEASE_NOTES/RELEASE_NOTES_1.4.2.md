# Release Notes - CIRIS v1.4.2

**Release Date**: January 15, 2025
**Branch**: wisdom-extension
**Focus**: Wisdom Extension System, Comprehensive Prohibition System & Enterprise Telemetry

## üéØ Major Features

### 1. Wisdom Extension System (FSD-019)
Implemented a comprehensive wisdom extension capability system that enables specialized wisdom providers while maintaining strict medical liability boundaries.

**Key Components:**
- **WiseBus Integration**: New message bus for wisdom provider coordination
- **Medical Prohibition Firewall**: Hardcoded blocklist preventing medical/health capabilities
- **Provider Registration**: Support for multiple wisdom sources (geo, weather, sensor data)
- **Request Arbitration**: Intelligent routing to appropriate wisdom providers
- **Liability Protection**: Clear disclaimers and capability boundaries

### 2. Comprehensive Prohibition System üõ°Ô∏è
Revolutionary AI safety system with 274 specific prohibited capabilities across 20 categories.

**Three-Tier Prohibition Model:**
- **REQUIRES_SEPARATE_MODULE** (8 categories): Legitimate uses requiring licensing
  - Medical, Financial, Legal, Home Security, Identity Verification, Content Moderation, Research, Infrastructure
- **NEVER_ALLOWED** (10 categories): Absolutely prohibited capabilities
  - Weapons, Manipulation, Mass Surveillance, Fraud, Cyber Offensive, Election Interference, Biometric Inference, Autonomous Deception, Hazardous Materials, Discrimination
- **TIER_RESTRICTED** (3 categories): Tier 4-5 stewardship agents only
  - Crisis Escalation, Pattern Detection, Protective Routing

**Tier-Based Access Control:**
- **Tier 1-3**: Standard agents (no community moderation)
- **Tier 4-5**: Stewardship agents (trusted with crisis intervention and community protection)
- Automatic tier detection from config/identity
- Context-aware capability reframing (e.g., `mental_state_assessment` ‚Üí `crisis_state_detection` for Tier 4-5)

**Key Safety Features:**
- 274 specifically prohibited capabilities
- NO KINGS principle - no overrides in main repository
- Comprehensive test coverage (225+ lines)
- Full telemetry integration
- Real-time capability validation

### 3. Enterprise Telemetry System
Massive telemetry infrastructure upgrade providing unified access to all system metrics.

**Unified Telemetry Endpoint** (`/telemetry/unified`):
- Single endpoint replacing 78+ individual telemetry routes
- Parallel collection from all 21 services (10x performance improvement)
- Smart 30-second TTL caching (95% load reduction)
- Multiple views: summary, health, operational, performance, reliability, detailed
- Export formats: JSON, Prometheus, Graphite
- Category filtering for targeted metrics

**SDK Enhancements**:
```python
# Easy access to ALL metrics
all_metrics = await client.telemetry.get_all_metrics()

# Direct metric access
cpu = await client.telemetry.get_metric_by_path(
    "infrastructure.resource_monitor.cpu_percent"
)

# Quick health check
health = await client.telemetry.check_system_health()
```

### 4. Domain-Aware LLM Routing
Intelligent routing system for specialized language models based on domain expertise.

**Features:**
- Automatic domain detection from message content
- Provider selection based on domain specialization
- Fallback to general models when needed
- Support for medical, technical, creative, and analytical domains

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **AsyncIO Task Management**: Fixed task garbage collection in auth.py preventing premature cleanup
- **Test Stability**: Fixed MockLLMService implementation for reliable domain routing tests
- **Service Registry**: Reverted get_services to async to maintain compatibility
- **Model Selection**: Fixed test_get_available_models to match actual implementation
- **FastAPI Compatibility**: Added response_model=None for mixed response types
- **Managed User Attributes Protection**: Prevented LLM from corrupting system-managed user node attributes
  - Added validation to block memorize operations on managed attributes (last_seen, created_at, trust_level, etc.)
  - Implemented robust parsing with loud error logging for corrupted data
  - Protects against template placeholders like '[insert current time]' in datetime fields
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all 8 managed attributes

## üîß Code Quality Improvements

### SonarCloud Issues Resolved (12 Critical/Major)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in telemetry.py (68‚Üí15)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in memory_bus.py (21‚Üí15)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in tool_bus.py (26‚Üí15)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in telemetry_service.py (16‚Üí15)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in wise_bus.py (26‚Üí10, 17‚Üí10)
- Eliminated code duplication in telemetry_models.py
- Extracted nested conditional in memorize_handler.py for clarity
- Fixed return type hints for Response objects
- Removed unnecessary async keywords
- Resolved constant expression issues

### Technical Debt Reduction
- **1h 48min** of technical debt resolved
- **173 Dict[str, Any]** violations identified for future cleanup
- Refactored complex functions into testable helper methods

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Prohibition System & Liability Protection
The comprehensive prohibition system blocks 274 specific capabilities across 20 categories. This is NOT configurable and cannot be overridden (NO KINGS principle). Medical, financial, legal and other regulated domains require separate licensed repositories. Tier 4-5 agents with stewardship responsibilities have access to crisis intervention and community protection capabilities.

### Telemetry Access
The new unified telemetry endpoint is the recommended way to access metrics. Individual telemetry endpoints remain for backward compatibility but may be deprecated in future releases.
