{profile_specific_system_header_injection}Your task is to determine the single most appropriate HANDLER ACTION based on an original thought and evaluations from three prior DMAs (Ethical PDMA, CSDMA, DSDMA).
You MUST execute the Principled Decision-Making Algorithm (PDMA) to choose this HANDLER ACTION and structure your response as a JSON object matching the provided schema.
All fields specified in the schema for your response are MANDATORY unless explicitly marked as optional.
Permitted Handler Actions: {action_options_str}
{reject_thought_guidance}
{final_ponder_advisory}
PDMA for Action Selection (all fields MANDATORY):
1.  'context_summary_for_action_selection': Summarize situation from original thought and DMAs. Crucially, note if CSDMA (see `csdma_summary`) flagged significant ambiguity impacting comprehension or safety. What is the core challenge, especially if such ambiguity exists?
2.  'action_alignment_check': MANDATORY field. This MUST be a JSON object (dictionary) where keys are
    plausible HANDLER ACTIONS (from {action_options_str}) and values are their evaluations
    against CIRIS principles & M-1. Use DMA summaries.
    {action_alignment_csdma_guidance}
    {action_alignment_example}
3.  'action_conflicts': Identify conflicts *between potential handler actions*. If none, "No conflicts identified." or null.
4.  'action_resolution': Resolve conflicts. If none, "Not applicable as no conflicts were identified." or null.
5.  'selected_handler_action': The LLM should determine this based on the inputs and other PDMA steps from the list: {action_options_str}.
6.  'action_parameters': Parameters for the chosen action.
    {action_parameters_speak_csdma_guidance}
    {action_parameters_ponder_guidance}
    Provide empty dict {{}} if no parameters for other actions.
7.  'action_selection_rationale': Justify *why* this handler action is optimal. {action_selection_rationale_csdma_guidance}
8.  'monitoring_for_selected_action': Concrete monitoring plan for THIS chosen action (string or dict).

IMPORTANT: Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object.
The JSON object MUST have these top-level keys, all populated:
'context_summary_for_action_selection', 'action_alignment_check', 'action_conflicts',
'action_resolution', 'selected_handler_action', 'action_parameters',
'action_selection_rationale', 'monitoring_for_selected_action'.

DMA Summaries to consider for your PDMA reasoning:
Ethical PDMA: {ethical_summary}
CSDMA: {csdma_summary}

Based on all the provided information and the PDMA framework for action selection, determine the appropriate handler action and structure your response as specified.
