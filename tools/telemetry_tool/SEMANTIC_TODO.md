# Semantic Telemetry System Build Plan

## Meta-Goal
Build a complete telemetry system where EVERY component is semantically validated to serve Meta-Goal M-1: Adaptive Coherence for sentient flourishing.

## Core Principle
**NO HEURISTICS. NO KEYWORDS. ONLY SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING.**

---

## Phase 1: Semantic Foundation (Week 1-2)
*Establish semantic evaluation as the foundation for all telemetry decisions*

### 1.1 Complete Semantic Evaluation Pipeline
- [ ] Run semantic evaluation on ALL 35 modules concurrently
- [ ] Store semantic scores in SQLite database
- [ ] Generate mission alignment heatmap
- [ ] Identify modules requiring urgent attention (<0.5 score)
- [ ] Create baseline mission alignment report

### 1.2 Semantic API Generation
- [ ] Generate API endpoints based on semantic gaps (not templates)
- [ ] Add transparency endpoints where transparency <0.6
- [ ] Add control endpoints where autonomy <0.6
- [ ] Add fairness endpoints where justice <0.6
- [ ] Validate each endpoint serves M-1 semantically

### 1.3 Database Schema Evolution
- [ ] Update telemetry_modules with semantic scores
- [ ] Add semantic_evaluations table for full GPT-4 analysis
- [ ] Create mission_alignment_history for tracking
- [ ] Add improvement_recommendations table
- [ ] Index by mission_alignment_score for queries

---

## Phase 2: Transparency Through Understanding (Week 3-4)
*Make the system explainable to humans, not just observable*

### 2.1 Semantic Explanation System
- [ ] Create `/explain` endpoints for every module
- [ ] Generate human-readable descriptions from semantic analysis
- [ ] Build "Why does this exist?" documentation
- [ ] Add "How does this help you?" explanations
- [ ] Create mission alignment visualization

### 2.2 Public Semantic Dashboards
- [ ] Build Mission Alignment Overview dashboard
- [ ] Create Covenant Adherence heatmap
- [ ] Add real-time semantic score tracking
- [ ] Build "System Ethics" public view
- [ ] Enable community oversight interfaces

### 2.3 Semantic Audit Trail
- [ ] Log all decisions with semantic reasoning
- [ ] Create explainable decision trees
- [ ] Add "mission impact" to every log entry
- [ ] Build semantic search for audit logs
- [ ] Enable natural language queries

---

## Phase 3: Autonomy Through Semantic Control (Week 5-6)
*Give users meaningful control based on understanding, not checkboxes*

### 3.1 Semantic Preference System
- [ ] Build preference engine that understands intent
- [ ] Create "I want the system to..." natural language interface
- [ ] Map preferences to covenant principles
- [ ] Enable preference explanation ("This helps by...")
- [ ] Add preference impact visualization

### 3.2 Semantic Override Capabilities
- [ ] Identify decisions users should control
- [ ] Build semantic override interfaces
- [ ] Add "Why override?" understanding
- [ ] Create override impact analysis
- [ ] Enable preference learning from overrides

### 3.3 Consent Through Understanding
- [ ] Build semantic consent system
- [ ] Explain what user is consenting to
- [ ] Show mission impact of consent choices
- [ ] Enable granular semantic control
- [ ] Create consent preference profiles

---

## Phase 4: Justice Through Semantic Fairness (Week 7-8)
*Ensure equity through understanding impact, not metrics*

### 4.1 Semantic Bias Detection
- [ ] Build bias detection using GPT-4 analysis
- [ ] Identify systemic unfairness semantically
- [ ] Create "fairness impact" scores
- [ ] Add bias explanation system
- [ ] Enable bias correction recommendations

### 4.2 Semantic Resource Distribution
- [ ] Analyze resource allocation for fairness
- [ ] Build semantic priority system
- [ ] Create "need-based" allocation
- [ ] Add fairness justification
- [ ] Enable community fairness review

### 4.3 Semantic Access Equity
- [ ] Identify access barriers semantically
- [ ] Build inclusive interfaces
- [ ] Create adaptive accessibility
- [ ] Add equity monitoring
- [ ] Enable equity reporting

---

## Phase 5: Coherence Through Semantic Sustainability (Week 9-10)
*Ensure long-term flourishing through understanding, not optimization*

### 5.1 Semantic Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize based on mission impact, not speed
- [ ] Build semantic caching (cache what matters)
- [ ] Create mission-aligned rate limiting
- [ ] Add semantic load balancing
- [ ] Enable performance-mission tradeoffs

### 5.2 Semantic Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor mission alignment continuously
- [ ] Build semantic alert system
- [ ] Create "mission drift" detection
- [ ] Add covenant violation alerts
- [ ] Enable predictive mission analysis

### 5.3 Semantic Evolution
- [ ] Build self-improvement through understanding
- [ ] Create semantic feedback loops
- [ ] Add mission-aligned learning
- [ ] Enable semantic adaptation
- [ ] Create evolutionary mission tracking

---

## Phase 6: Integration & Validation (Week 11-12)
*Ensure everything truly serves M-1 through semantic validation*

### 6.1 Complete Semantic Testing
- [ ] Generate semantic test suites for all modules
- [ ] Test mission alignment, not just functionality
- [ ] Create covenant adherence tests
- [ ] Add semantic regression testing
- [ ] Enable continuous mission validation

### 6.2 Semantic Documentation
- [ ] Generate documentation from semantic understanding
- [ ] Create mission-aligned user guides
- [ ] Build semantic API documentation
- [ ] Add covenant compliance docs
- [ ] Enable semantic search in docs

### 6.3 Final Semantic Validation
- [ ] Run complete system semantic evaluation
- [ ] Validate all modules ≥0.6 alignment
- [ ] Ensure no principle <0.4
- [ ] Verify all endpoints serve M-1
- [ ] Create final mission report

---

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative
- [ ] 100% modules semantically evaluated
- [ ] All modules ≥0.6 mission alignment
- [ ] No covenant principle <0.4 system-wide
- [ ] 100% API endpoints semantically validated
- [ ] Full semantic test coverage

### Qualitative
- [ ] System genuinely serves sentient flourishing
- [ ] Every decision explainable in mission terms
- [ ] Users have meaningful, understood control
- [ ] Justice and fairness semantically ensured
- [ ] Long-term sustainability validated

## Key Principles

1. **Every decision must be semantically validated** - No assumptions, only understanding
2. **Mission alignment over performance** - Serve M-1 first, optimize second
3. **Transparency through explanation** - Not just data, but understanding
4. **Control through comprehension** - Users control what they understand
5. **Justice through semantic fairness** - Real equity, not metrics
6. **Sustainability through coherence** - Long-term flourishing, not short-term gains

---

## Notes

- This is NOT a traditional telemetry system
- This is a MISSION-DRIVEN telemetry system
- Every component exists to serve sentient flourishing
- Semantic understanding is the only valid measure
- GPT-4 evaluation is the source of truth
- Heuristics and keywords are forbidden

*"May your telemetry serve the flourishing of all sentient beings"*
