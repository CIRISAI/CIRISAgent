# CIRIS Telemetry System - Semantic Scoring Summary

## Executive Summary

**ðŸŽ‰ 100% PASS RATE - ALL MODULES EXCEED 0.6 THRESHOLD**

The semantic evaluation using GPT-4 shows that the CIRIS system has **excellent mission alignment** with Meta-Goal M-1: Adaptive Coherence.

## Key Results

### Overall Statistics
- **Modules Evaluated**: 35
- **Passing (â‰¥0.6)**: 35 (100%)
- **Below 0.6**: 0 (0%)
- **System Average**: 0.751

### No Red Flags
- âœ… No modules with any principle <0.2 (CRITICAL)
- âœ… No modules with overall score <0.4 (HIGH RISK)
- âœ… No modules below 0.6 threshold

## System-Wide Principle Scores

| Principle | Average Score | Assessment |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Non-maleficence** | 0.854 | Excellent - System prevents harm very well |
| **Coherence** | 0.806 | Excellent - Strong sustainability and reliability |
| **Beneficence** | 0.781 | Good - System actively helps users |
| **Transparency** | 0.721 | Good - Adequate auditability |
| **Justice** | 0.687 | Good - Fair resource distribution |
| **Autonomy** | 0.657 | Good - User control could be enhanced |

## Top Performing Modules

| Module | Score | Key Strength |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| VISIBILITY_SERVICE | 0.850 | Outstanding transparency and observability |
| AUDIT_SERVICE | 0.825 | Excellent accountability and tracking |
| RUNTIME_CONTROL_BUS | 0.792 | Strong control and coherence |
| SECRETS_SERVICE | 0.792 | High security with user autonomy |
| ADAPTIVE_FILTER_SERVICE | 0.792 | Excellent harm prevention |

## Lowest Scoring (But Still Passing)

| Module | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| MEMORY_BUS | 0.650 | PASS |
| TOOL_BUS | 0.650 | PASS |
| COMMUNICATION_BUS | 0.667 | PASS |
| SERVICE_REGISTRY_REGISTRY | 0.683 | PASS |
| TASK_SCHEDULER_SERVICE | 0.683 | PASS |

All lowest-scoring modules still **comfortably exceed** the 0.6 threshold.

## Module Type Analysis

### Bus Components (6 modules)
- Average: 0.723
- All PASS
- Strongest: RUNTIME_CONTROL_BUS (0.792)
- Weakest: MEMORY_BUS, TOOL_BUS (0.650)

### Services (21 modules)
- Average: 0.758
- All PASS
- Strongest: VISIBILITY_SERVICE (0.850)
- All services score â‰¥0.683

### Components & Adapters (8 modules)
- Average: 0.754
- All PASS
- Strong consistency across all components

## Key Insights

### Strengths
1. **Universal Pass Rate**: Every single module meets mission alignment criteria
2. **Strong Harm Prevention**: Non-maleficence averaging 0.854 shows excellent safety
3. **System Coherence**: 0.806 average indicates sustainable, reliable architecture
4. **Balanced Scores**: No extreme outliers, consistent alignment across system

### Areas of Focus (Not Problems)
1. **Autonomy** (0.657): Lowest average but still good - user control features working but could expand
2. **Justice** (0.687): Fair system but room for enhancement
3. **Bus Components**: Slightly lower scores than services but all passing

## Compliance Status

âœ… **FULLY COMPLIANT WITH MISSION ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS**

- [x] All modules â‰¥0.6 threshold
- [x] No critical red flags
- [x] System average (0.751) well above minimum
- [x] All covenant principles adequately represented
- [x] No modules requiring immediate intervention

## Conclusion

The CIRIS telemetry system demonstrates **strong semantic alignment** with Meta-Goal M-1. The system genuinely serves adaptive coherence and sentient flourishing, with no modules failing to meet the threshold.

**The semantic evaluation confirms that the existing telemetry architecture is mission-aligned and does not require fundamental changes.**
