# Release v1.0.3-RC1-patch3

**Release Date:** August 26, 2025
**Type:** Critical Hotfix
**Branch:** 1.0-RC1-patch3

## Critical Production Fixes

### Fixed

1. **Import Error in User Node Corruption Auto-Repair**
   - Error: `No module named 'ciris_engine.schemas.memory'`
   - Impact: User nodes with LLM-corrupted timestamps were not being automatically repaired
   - Fix: Corrected imports from non-existent `ciris_engine.schemas.memory.core` to `ciris_engine.schemas.services.graph_core`

2. **GraphScope Scoping Issue**
   - Error: `cannot access local variable 'GraphScope' where it is not associated with a value`
   - Impact: Variable scoping errors in nested try blocks
   - Fix: Removed redundant local imports, moved `json_serial` function to module level

3. **User Profile Extraction Failures**
   - Issue: User profiles returning empty set instead of extracting from context
   - Impact: Missing user context in agent operations
   - Fix: Enhanced extraction from task context, thought mentions, and correlation history

4. **Corruption Detection and Auto-Repair**
   - Issue: Template placeholders like `2024-09-16T[insert current time]Z` not being fixed
   - Impact: Corrupted user data persisting in graph database
   - Fix: Proper detection and automatic repair with current timestamps

## Enhancements

### User Profile Extraction
- Extract users from task context (PRIMARY source)
- Extract users from Discord mentions (`<@ID>` patterns)
- Extract users from correlation history (conversation participants)
- Comprehensive logging: "3 User Profiles queried - X bytes added to context"

### Testing Infrastructure
- Added `tests/fixtures/mocks.py` with proper mock objects
- Created comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
- 48 tests passing (was 10 failing)

## Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for corruption fix
- Added user profile extraction tests
- All 48 related tests pass successfully

## Deployment Notes

This is a critical hotfix that should be deployed immediately to production.

### Deployment Steps:
1. Deploy patch3 to production
2. Monitor `incidents_latest.log` for any "INVALID DATA" entries
3. Verify user node corruption auto-repair is working
4. Check user profile extraction in logs

### Verification:
Check logs for successful operations:
```bash
grep "INVALID DATA" logs/incidents_latest.log
grep "Failed to fix corrupted node" logs/incidents_latest.log
grep "USER EXTRACTION" logs/incidents_latest.log
grep "CONTEXT BUILD" logs/incidents_latest.log
```

Success indicators:
- "INVALID DATA" entries followed by successful fixes
- No "Failed to fix" errors
- User extraction logs showing discovered users
- Context build logs showing bytes added
