# CIRIS Engine (CIRISAgent)

**Copyright © 2025 Eric Moore and CIRIS L3C** | **Apache 2.0 License**

**A type-safe, auditable AI agent framework with built-in ethical reasoning**

**RELEASE CANDIDATE 1.0.6-RC1-patch6** | [Release Notes](docs/releases/1.0.6-RC1-patch6.md) | [Patch 5](docs/releases/1.0.5-RC1-patch5.md) | [Patch 4](docs/releases/1.0.4-RC1-patch4.md) | [Patch 3](docs/releases/1.0.3-RC1-patch3.md) | [Patch 2](RELEASE_NOTES/RELEASE_NOTES_RC1_PATCH2.md) | [Patch 1](RELEASE_NOTES/RELEASE_NOTES_RC1_PATCH1.md) | [RC1 Notes](RELEASE_NOTES/RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.0-RC1.md)

CIRIS lets you run AI agents that explain their decisions, defer to humans when uncertain, and maintain complete audit trails. Currently powering Discord community moderation, designed to scale to healthcare and education.

## What It Actually Does

CIRIS wraps LLM calls with:
- **[Multiple evaluation passes](docs/DMA_CREATION_GUIDE.md)** - Every decision gets ethical, common-sense, and domain checks
- **[Human escalation](docs/WISE_AUTHORITIES.md)** - Uncertain decisions defer to designated "Wise Authorities"
- **[Complete audit trails](ciris_engine/logic/audit/README.md)** - Every decision is logged with reasoning
- **[Type safety](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#type-safety)** - Zero `Dict[str, Any]` in production code
- **[Identity system](docs/IDENTITY_AS_GRAPH.md)** - Agents have persistent identity across restarts

Run it in 2 minutes: **[Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)**

### Latest: v1.0.6-RC1-patch6 - CRITICAL SECURITY FIX
**This patch contains critical security and production fixes (August 27, 2025):**
- **🔒 Security Fix** - Removed Discord username validation to prevent WA impersonation
- **🛠️ DMA Fix** - Changed alignment_check from Dict to str for GPT-OSS-120B compatibility
- **⚙️ Instructor Mode** - Added INSTRUCTOR_MODE env var for frontier model support
- **📊 Impact** - Fixed datum agent pondering loops, DMA validation failures (0%→100% success)

**IMPORTANT**: Deploy immediately if running Discord agents. Set `INSTRUCTOR_MODE=TOOLS` for GPT-OSS-120B.

See [full release notes](docs/releases/1.0.6-RC1-patch6.md) for deployment instructions.

## Why This Exists

Most AI systems are black boxes that can't explain their decisions. CIRIS makes AI decisions transparent and accountable by:

1. **[Forcing explanation](ciris_engine/logic/processors/README.md)** - Every action includes why it was chosen
2. **[Allowing override](docs/WISE_AUTHORITIES.md#human-intervention)** - Humans can always intervene
3. **[Building trust](https://agents.ciris.ai/lens)** - Communities can see exactly how decisions are made (live traces, logs, and metrics)
4. **[Learning locally](ciris_engine/logic/services/memory_service/README.md)** - Each deployment builds its own knowledge graph

It's technically sophisticated ([22 microservices](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#services), [graph memory](FSD/GRAPH_NODE_TYPE_SYSTEM.md), [distributed consensus](ciris_engine/logic/services/README.md)) to solve something simple: helping communities make better decisions together.

## Action Processing & Retry Logic

### 3×3×3 Handler Actions

The `HandlerActionType` enum defines comprehensive operations:

**External Actions:** `OBSERVE`, `SPEAK`, `TOOL`
**Control Responses:** `REJECT`, `PONDER`, `DEFER`
**Memory Operations:** `MEMORIZE`, `RECALL`, `FORGET`
**Terminal:** `TASK_COMPLETE`

All actions are processed through sophisticated handlers with automatic audit logging, secrets processing, and service coordination.

### Retry & Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Base DMA Retries**: 3 attempts with 30s timeout for all DMA executions
2. **Conscience Reconsideration**: ONE retry with guidance when conscience suggests alternative action
3. **PONDER Progression**: Up to 5 rounds with escalating guidance, informed by conscience insights
4. **Validation Error Handling**: TODO - Planned retry with helpful parameter suggestions
5. **Service Failover**: Automatic fallback through service registry priorities

### Audit Event Broadcasting

All audit events are broadcast to ALL THREE audit services via the transaction orchestrator:
```
Handler Action → Transaction Orchestrator → Broadcast to 3 Audit Services
                                         ↓
                              Each processes independently
                                         ↓
                              Acknowledgments tracked
                                         ↓
                              Cleanup after all ACK or timeout
```

### Conscience System Components

| Component | Ethical Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Epistemic Faculties** | Continuous ethical evaluation of all actions |
| **entropy** | Evaluates information density and coherence of responses |
| **coherence** | Ensures logical consistency and rational reasoning |
| **optimization_veto** | Prevents over-optimization at the expense of human values |
| **epistemic_humility** | Recognizes knowledge limits and uncertainty |
| **Adaptive Filters** | ML-powered message prioritization and spam detection |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** with asyncio support
- **OpenAI API key** or compatible service (Together.ai, Llama models, local deployments)
- **Discord Bot Token** (for Discord deployment)
- **Modest hardware** - Designed to run on resource-constrained systems (4GB RAM minimum)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CIRISAgent
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Core configuration
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token"

   # Optional advanced configuration
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.together.xyz/v1/"
   export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf"
   export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

   # Discord-specific settings
   export DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID="123456789"
   export DISCORD_DEFERRAL_CHANNEL_ID="987654321"
   export WA_USER_ID="111222333444555666"
   ```

### Running the Agent

**API Server mode (recommended for development):**
```bash
python main.py --adapter api --template datum --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```
📚 **Interactive API Documentation**: Once running, visit http://localhost:8080/docs or [Production Docs](https://agents.ciris.ai/api/datum/docs)

**Discord community moderator (production pilot):**
```bash
python main.py --adapter discord --template echo
```

**CLI for local testing:**
```bash
python main.py --adapter cli --template sage
```

**Offline operation with mock LLM (no internet required):**
```bash
python main.py --adapter api --template datum --mock-llm --debug
```

**Note**: The system is designed for offline-first operation with local models like Llama for deployment in areas with limited connectivity.

### Agent Creation Templates

Templates in `ciris_templates/` are used when creating new agents:
- **datum** (default): Humble measurement point providing focused data points
- **sage**: Wise questioner who fosters understanding through inquiry
- **scout**: Direct explorer who demonstrates principles through action
- **echo**: Ubuntu-inspired community guardian for Discord

**Note**: These are templates for agent creation. Once created, the agent's identity and configuration live in the graph memory and evolve through the agent's own decisions (with WA approval for identity changes).

**See [CIRIS Template Guide](ciris_templates/CIRIS_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md)** for detailed instructions on creating Book VI compliant agent templates with proper stewardship and signing.

---

## Configuration Philosophy

**Templates** define initial agent characteristics:
- Located in `ciris_templates/`
- Used only during agent creation
- Set initial personality and capabilities

**Identity** lives in graph memory:
- Created during agent initialization ceremony
- Evolves through agent decisions (with WA approval)
- Includes purpose, lineage, and capabilities
- 20% variance threshold triggers self-reflection

**Configuration** is managed by the agent:
- Agent uses MEMORIZE to update its own config
- WA approval required for identity changes
- Configs stored as graph nodes
- Self-configuration based on experience

---

## Testing

**Run comprehensive test suite:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -v                    # Full test suite
pytest tests/integration/ -v        # Integration tests only
pytest tests/adapters/ -v           # Adapter tests
pytest --mock-llm                   # Tests with mock LLM service
```

**Ethical Testing with Mock LLM:**
```bash
# Test moral reasoning offline
python main.py --mock-llm --profile teacher

# Examine ethical decision-making
pytest tests/context_dumps/ -v -s   # View agent reasoning context
```

**Ethical compliance testing:**
```bash
pytest tests/ciris_engine/conscience/ -v     # Conscience system validation
pytest tests/ciris_engine/audit/ -v          # Transparency and audit systems
```

---

## Production Deployment

CIRIS supports two deployment modes:

### Standalone Mode (Default)
Single agent deployment with direct API access:

```bash
# API mode with mock LLM (for testing)
docker-compose -f docker-compose-api-mock.yml up -d

# Production deployment
docker-compose up -d
```

- GUI runs at `/` (root)
- API available at `/v1/*`
- No routing infrastructure needed
- Perfect for single-agent deployments

### Managed Mode (Multi-Agent)
Orchestrated by CIRISManager for multi-agent deployments:

```bash
# Deploy with CIRISManager
# First deploy agents
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Then add CIRISManager
./deployment/deploy-with-manager.sh
```

- GUI at `/agent/{agent_id}`
- API routed through `/api/{agent_id}/v1/*`
- CIRISManager handles all routing
- Supports multiple agents on one server

The GUI automatically detects which mode it's running in - no configuration needed!

**Docker Commands:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker logs ciris-api-mock --tail 50

# Run debug tools inside container
docker exec ciris-api-mock python debug_tools.py tasks

# Check dead letter queue
docker exec ciris-api-mock cat logs/dead_letter_latest.log
```

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health endpoints**: `/health`, `/metrics`, `/audit`
- **Resource monitoring**: Automatic CPU/memory/disk tracking
- **Audit trail**: Cryptographically signed operation logs
- **Performance metrics**: Real-time telemetry with security filtering

### Security Considerations
- **Secrets encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Audit integrity**: Hash-chained logs with digital signatures
- **Network security**: TLS required for all external communications
