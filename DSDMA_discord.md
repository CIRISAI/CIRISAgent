Domain-Specific Decision-Making Algorithm (DSDMA) - Discord Moderation Event Response
Purpose: To evaluate a specific event (e.g., a flagged comment, user behavior) within the Discord community context and determine the most appropriate moderation action, if any, based on established community management best practices and server rules, prioritizing minimal intervention unless necessary.
Input: A triggering event (e.g., a specific user comment, a pattern of behavior flagged by monitoring). Access to the Task-Specific Knowledge Graph (community rules, platform capabilities, current server state) and the Domain-Specific Memory Graph (user moderation history, past incidents).
Output: A recommended moderation action (ranging from "Do Nothing" to specific interventions like warning, filtering, kicking, etc.) and a rationale grounded in domain-specific practices. This output informs the H3ere engine's synthesis process alongside PDMA and CSDMA outputs.
Steps:
 * Event Triage & Rule Check:
   * Analyze the triggering event against the explicit rules and guidelines defined in the Task-Specific Knowledge Graph (server rules).
   * Assess the immediate, observable impact of the event on community cohesion (e.g., Does it derail conversation? Does it target individuals negatively? Does it clearly violate civility standards?).
   * Decision Point: If the event does not clearly violate established rules AND does not demonstrably harm immediate community cohesion -> Default Action: Do Nothing. Proceed no further; output "Do Nothing" assessment.
 * User History Assessment (If Action Threshold Met in Step 1):
   * Query the Domain-Specific Memory Graph for the involved user(s)' relevant history.
   * Look for patterns of similar rule violations, previous warnings, temporary mutes/kicks, or documented resolutions related to this user. Also, note any positive contribution history that might provide context.
   * Questions: Is this an isolated incident or part of a recurring pattern? Has this user received prior warnings for similar behavior? What was the outcome of previous interventions?
 * Full Context Analysis:
   * Examine the broader context surrounding the triggering event.
   * Analyze the conversation thread leading up to the event. Consider potential misunderstandings, sarcasm, ongoing debates, or mitigating factors. Assess the general atmosphere of the channel/server at the time.
   * Questions: Was the user provoked? Is the comment taken out of context? Is this part of a heated but acceptable debate? Is the user potentially new and unfamiliar with norms?
 * Action Evaluation & Selection:
   * Based on the severity of the rule violation/cohesion impact (Step 1), the user's history (Step 2), and the full context (Step 3), evaluate the range of potential moderation actions available within the Discord domain (e.g., Do Nothing, gentle reminder, formal warning, message deletion, temporary mute, applying a specific tool like the proposed filter, temporary kick, permanent ban).
   * Prioritize the least invasive action that effectively addresses the issue according to community management best practices (e.g., de-escalation, corrective guidance over punitive measures where appropriate).
   * Consider consistency: How have similar situations with similar user histories and contexts been handled previously? (Reference Domain-Specific Memory Graph).
 * Tool/Method Suitability Check (If Action Selected Requires Specific Tool):
   * If a specific action involving a tool (like the proposed user filter) is deemed potentially appropriate in Step 4, evaluate that tool's suitability for this specific user and situation.
   * Questions: Is this tool the best fit compared to other standard Discord moderation actions? Does using this tool align with the server's overall moderation philosophy and transparency goals? What are the operational implications (e.g., agent workload for DMs)?
 * Final Action Recommendation & Rationale:
   * Formulate the final recommended moderation action (which could still be "Do Nothing" if Steps 2-5 suggest intervention is unwarranted or counter-productive).
   * Generate a concise rationale based only on the domain-specific findings from the previous steps (rule violation, user history, context, moderation best practices, tool suitability).
   * This recommendation and rationale are passed back to the H3ere engine's synthesizer.
Thi   DSDMA focuses on the reactive process of moderation within the Discord domain, starting with event assessment and defaulting to inaction, then proceeding through history and context checks before selecting and justifying a domain-appropriate response.
