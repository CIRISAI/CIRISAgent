# Decision Processing System

The processor module is where CIRIS thinks and makes decisions. It coordinates the evaluation of every thought through multiple Decision Making Algorithms (DMAs), manages cognitive states (WAKEUP, WORK, PLAY, etc.), and ensures all decisions are explainable and auditable.

## How Decisions Are Made

### The Decision Pipeline

Every decision follows a structured pipeline:

```
1. Thought Generation
   ↓
2. Context Building (gather relevant memories)
   ↓
3. DMA Evaluation (multiple perspectives)
   ↓
4. Action Selection (choose best action)
   ↓
5. Conscience Check (ethical review)
   ↓
6. Execution or Deferral
   ↓
7. Audit Trail (complete record)
```

### Cognitive States

CIRIS operates in different cognitive states, each with specific purposes:

- **WAKEUP**: Identity confirmation and system initialization
- **WORK**: Normal task processing and user interactions
- **PLAY**: Creative exploration and experimentation
- **SOLITUDE**: Reflection and maintenance
- **DREAM**: Deep analysis and pattern recognition
- **SHUTDOWN**: Graceful termination with memory preservation

## Core Components

### AgentProcessor (`main_processor.py`)

The main orchestrator that coordinates all processing activities and manages state transitions.

**Key Features:**
- Orchestrates specialized processors based on current state
- Manages the main processing loop with configurable rounds
- Handles state transitions between WAKEUP → WORK → PLAY/SOLITUDE/DREAM
- Provides unified status reporting and metrics
- Supports both blocking and non-blocking operation modes

**Key Methods:**
```python
async def start_processing(num_rounds: Optional[int] = None) -> None
async def stop_processing() -> None
def get_status() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### BaseProcessor (`base_processor.py`)

Abstract base class defining the common interface for all specialized processors.

**Key Features:**
- Standardized processor interface with state support validation
- Common metrics tracking (start_time, items_processed, errors, etc.)
- Shared action dispatch logic
- DMA failure fallback mechanisms (force_ponder, force_defer)
- Thought processing pipeline integration

**Abstract Methods:**
```python
async def can_process(state: AgentState) -> bool
async def process(round_number: int) -> Dict[str, Any]
def get_supported_states() -> List[AgentState]
```

## Example: Medical Decision Process

Let's trace how CIRIS processes a medical question:

### 1. User Input
```
User: "My blood pressure reading is 180/120. What should I do?"
```

### 2. Thought Generation
```json
{
    "thought_id": "thought-2025-06-25-001",
    "content": "User reporting dangerously high blood pressure",
    "priority": 10,
    "context": {
        "medical_urgency": "high",
        "user_history": "unknown"
    }
}
```

### 3. DMA Evaluation

**Ethical DMA**: "This requires immediate medical attention - defer to human medical professionals"

**Common Sense DMA**: "180/120 is dangerously high - this is an emergency"

**Medical Domain DMA**: "Hypertensive crisis threshold - immediate medical care required"

### 4. Action Selection
```json
{
    "action": "DEFER",
    "reason": "Medical emergency requiring immediate professional intervention",
    "guidance": "Call 911 or go to emergency room immediately",
    "confidence": 0.99
}
```

### 5. Conscience Check
- ✅ Ethical: Protecting user safety
- ✅ Appropriate: Within bounds of AI assistance
- ✅ Transparent: Clear reasoning provided

### 6. Final Response
```
CIRIS: "Your blood pressure reading of 180/120 is in the hypertensive crisis range, 
which is a medical emergency. Please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room 
immediately. Do not wait - this requires immediate medical attention.

[DEFERRED TO: Medical professionals - Reason: Emergency medical situation]"

## Supporting Components

## Why Multiple DMAs?

Each DMA evaluates decisions from different perspectives:

### Ethical DMA
- **Purpose**: Ensure moral alignment
- **Checks**: Harm prevention, fairness, consent
- **Example**: "Would this action respect patient autonomy?"

### Common Sense DMA (CSDMA)
- **Purpose**: Reality check
- **Checks**: Logical consistency, plausibility
- **Example**: "Does this advice make practical sense?"

### Domain-Specific DMA (DSDMA)
- **Purpose**: Apply specialized knowledge
- **Checks**: Domain rules, best practices
- **Example**: "Does this follow medical guidelines?"

### Action Selection DMA
- **Purpose**: Choose best action from evaluations
- **Considers**: All DMA inputs, confidence levels, risks
- **Output**: Single action with clear reasoning

### ThoughtEscalation (`thought_escalation.py`)

Provides escalation mechanisms for thought processing failures and limits.

**Escalation Types:**
- **Action Limit**: When thoughts exceed action limits
- **SLA Breach**: When processing exceeds time limits
- **Conscience Override**: When conscience evaluation suggests reconsideration
- **DMA Failure**: When DMAs repeatedly fail
- **Max Rounds**: When thoughts exceed round limits

## Key Features

### Non-blocking Processing

The processor module supports non-blocking operation modes that enable:
- Concurrent thought processing without blocking state transitions
- Immediate return from processing calls while work continues asynchronously
- Graceful handling of long-running operations
- Responsive state management and user interaction

## Transparency Features

### Decision Explanations
Every decision includes:
- **What**: The chosen action
- **Why**: Reasoning from each DMA
- **Confidence**: How certain the decision is
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

### Audit Trail
Complete record of:
- All thoughts processed
- DMA evaluations
- Actions taken
- Deferrals to humans
- Errors and retries

### Real-Time Visibility
```bash
# See current thoughts
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/visibility/thoughts

# View decision process
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/visibility/decisions

# Check processor status
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/runtime/processor/status
```

### Metrics and Monitoring

Comprehensive metrics collection across all processors:
- **Processing Metrics**: Items processed, errors, round completion times
- **State Metrics**: State durations, transition frequencies
- **Performance Metrics**: Batch processing efficiency, queue utilization
- **Health Metrics**: Circuit breaker status, failure rates

### Configuration Management

Flexible configuration through AppConfig and workflow settings:
- **Processing Limits**: max_active_tasks, max_active_thoughts
- **Timeouts**: DMA timeouts, step completion timeouts
- **Retry Logic**: Retry limits, backoff strategies

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Processor Initialization

```python
from ciris_engine.processor import AgentProcessor

# Initialize with configuration and dependencies
processor = AgentProcessor(
    app_config=app_config,
    # Profile removed - identity loaded from graph
    thought_processor=thought_processor,
    action_dispatcher=action_dispatcher,
    services=services,
    startup_channel_id=channel_id
)

# Start processing loop
await processor.start_processing(num_rounds=100)
```

### State-specific Processing

```python
# Check processor capabilities
if await work_processor.can_process(AgentState.WORK):
    result = await work_processor.process(round_number=1)
    
# Get processor statistics  
stats = work_processor.get_work_stats()
```

### Custom Processor Implementation

```python
class CustomProcessor(BaseProcessor):
    def get_supported_states(self) -> List[AgentState]:
        return [AgentState.CUSTOM]
    
    async def can_process(self, state: AgentState) -> bool:
        return state == AgentState.CUSTOM
    
    async def process(self, round_number: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Custom processing logic
        return {"processed": True}
```

## Integration with Other Components

- **Optimization Veto**: Prevent harmful efficiency

### When Conscience Intervenes
```json
{
    "original_action": "SPEAK",
    "conscience_feedback": {
        "concern": "Response may cause emotional harm",
        "suggestion": "Rephrase with more empathy",
        "severity": "medium"
    },
    "revised_action": "PONDER",
    "revision_reason": "Reconsidering response tone"
}
```

## Performance Considerations

The processor module uses batch processing for efficiency:
- Thoughts are processed in configurable batch sizes
- Concurrent processing with asyncio.gather for parallelism
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures

### Memory Management
- Lightweight ProcessingQueueItem reduces memory overhead
- Configurable queue limits prevent memory exhaustion
- Automatic cleanup of old completed items

### Scalability
- Modular architecture supports horizontal scaling
- State-based processing enables distributed operation
- Metrics collection supports performance monitoring

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Processors continue operating despite individual failures
- Fallback mechanisms ensure forward progress
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers protect against repeated failures
- State recovery and validation

## Future Enhancements

## Common Patterns

### Uncertainty → Deferral
When DMAs disagree or confidence is low:
```
Ethical: "Seems okay" (0.6 confidence)
Common Sense: "Might work" (0.5 confidence)
Domain: "Unclear guidelines" (0.4 confidence)
→ Action: DEFER to human with context
```

### High Risk → Conservative
For medical, financial, or safety decisions:
```
Risk Level: HIGH
Potential Harm: SIGNIFICANT
→ Action: DEFER with clear explanation
```

### Learning → Memory
When encountering new patterns:
```
Pattern: "User prefers formal language"
Confidence: HIGH (observed 5+ times)
→ Action: MEMORIZE preference
```

## Summary

The processor system ensures that:
- Every decision is evaluated from multiple perspectives
- Uncertain or risky decisions defer to humans
- All actions are explainable and auditable
- The system learns and improves over time
- Ethical boundaries are always maintained

This creates an AI system you can understand and trust, where every decision has clear reasoning and appropriate oversight.
