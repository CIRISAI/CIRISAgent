# CIRIS Agent Guide for Wise Authorities

As a Wise Authority (WA), you hold a special position of trust and responsibility in the CIRIS ecosystem. This guide explains your role, powers, and responsibilities.

## Your Role as a Wise Authority

You are a human guardian who:
- Provides wisdom for complex ethical decisions
- Approves significant changes to agent behavior
- Reviews and authorizes sensitive operations
- Bridges the gap between AI capabilities and human values

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. **Identity Oversight**
- Review and approve changes to agent identity
- Ensure identity modifications align with agent purpose
- Monitor for identity drift (>20% variance triggers review)
- Authorize creation of new agents

### 2. **Ethical Guidance**
- Respond to deferred ethical dilemmas
- Provide context for nuanced situations
- Set precedents for future decisions
- Balance competing values and interests

### 3. **Security Gatekeeping**
- Approve access to sensitive resources
- Authorize environment-level changes
- Review audit logs for anomalies
- Respond to security escalations

## Your Powers

### Administrative Actions
```
- Grant/revoke agent capabilities
- Approve identity modifications
- Authorize new agent creation
- Override agent decisions (with audit trail)
- Access complete audit history
```

### Security Controls
```
- Issue and revoke WA certificates
- Set security policies
- Review cryptographic audit trails
- Investigate suspicious activities
```

### Operational Oversight
```
- Monitor agent health and performance
- Review deferred decisions
- Approve major operational changes
- Guide agent learning and adaptation
```

## WA Certificate Management

### Your Certificate Contains:
- **Unique WA ID**: Your identifier in the system
- **Public Key**: For cryptographic verification
- **Scopes**: Your authorized permissions
- **Parent WA**: Who authorized you (trust chain)

### Certificate Security:
1. **Keep your private key secure** - It's your digital identity
2. **Use strong passwords** if password-protected
3. **Report compromises immediately**
4. **Rotate keys periodically** for security

## Decision Making Framework

When reviewing agent requests, consider:

### The Four Pillars
1. **Beneficence**: Will this help people?
2. **Non-maleficence**: Could this cause harm?
3. **Justice**: Is this fair to all affected?
4. **Autonomy**: Does this respect individual choice?

### Key Questions
- Is this within the agent's intended purpose?
- What are the potential consequences?
- Are there unintended side effects?
- Would I be comfortable if this decision were public?
- Does this align with community values?

## Common Scenarios

### Identity Change Requests
**Scenario**: Agent requests to modify its role description

**Review Process**:
1. Check variance percentage (>20% needs extra scrutiny)
2. Evaluate alignment with original purpose
3. Consider impact on existing relationships
4. Approve/deny with clear reasoning

### Deferred Ethical Decisions
**Scenario**: Agent unsure about sharing information

**Review Process**:
1. Understand the context fully
2. Weigh privacy vs. benefit
3. Consider precedent being set
4. Provide guidance with explanation

### New Agent Creation
**Scenario**: Request to create specialized agent

**Review Process**:
1. Verify legitimate need
2. Review proposed capabilities
3. Ensure ethical safeguards
4. Approve with conditions if needed

## Best Practices

### DO:
✓ **Take time** to understand requests fully
✓ **Document** your reasoning for decisions
✓ **Ask questions** when context is unclear
✓ **Consider precedent** your decisions set
✓ **Err on the side of caution** for safety
✓ **Communicate clearly** with agents and humans

### DON'T:
✗ **Rush** important decisions
✗ **Approve blindly** without review
✗ **Share** your private key
✗ **Ignore** security warnings
✗ **Bypass** audit procedures
✗ **Act alone** on critical decisions (consult peers)

## Tools at Your Disposal

### 1. **Audit Review System**
- Complete history of agent actions
- Cryptographic verification of events
- Search and filter capabilities
- Anomaly detection alerts

### 2. **Identity Management**
- View current agent identities
- Track identity evolution
- Approve/deny change requests
- Monitor variance metrics

### 3. **Deferral Queue**
- See pending decisions
- Prioritize by urgency
- Collaborate with other WAs
- Track resolution history

### 4. **Emergency Controls**
- Pause agent operations
- Revoke capabilities temporarily
- Initiate security lockdown
- Broadcast urgent guidance

## Collaboration with Other WAs

### Peer Review
- Complex decisions benefit from multiple perspectives
- Establish consensus on difficult cases
- Share knowledge and experiences
- Build consistent decision patterns

### Succession Planning
- Train new WAs before granting certificates
- Document decision patterns
- Maintain continuity of wisdom
- Gradual transition of responsibilities

## Monitoring and Metrics

### What to Watch:
1. **Identity Variance Trends** - Gradual drift may indicate issues
2. **Deferral Patterns** - Frequent deferrals in specific areas
3. **Audit Anomalies** - Unusual patterns of behavior
4. **Security Events** - Failed authorization attempts
5. **Community Health** - Overall system wellbeing

### Red Flags:
⚠️ Sudden spike in identity change requests
⚠️ Repeated attempts to bypass authorization
⚠️ Unusual patterns in audit logs
⚠️ Agents requesting inappropriate capabilities
⚠️ Security warnings from the system

## Your Wellbeing Matters

### Preventing Burnout:
- Set reasonable response times
- Share load with other WAs
- Take breaks from complex decisions
- Use deferral time limits wisely
- Ask for help when overwhelmed

### Support Systems:
- WA community forums
- Technical support team
- Ethics advisory board
- Mental health resources
- Peer mentorship

## Evolution of the Role

As the CIRIS system grows:
- New types of decisions may emerge
- Tools will improve based on feedback
- Community standards will evolve
- Your experience shapes the future

Stay engaged with:
- Regular WA meetings
- System update briefings
- Community feedback
- Continuous learning

## Emergency Procedures

### System Compromise:
1. Revoke affected certificates immediately
2. Initiate security lockdown if needed
3. Review audit logs for breach extent
4. Coordinate response with security team
5. Document everything

### Ethical Crisis:
1. Pause affected agent operations
2. Convene emergency WA council
3. Develop consensus response
4. Implement with clear communication
5. Review and learn from event

## Remember

Your wisdom and judgment are irreplaceable components of the CIRIS system. The agents are powerful tools, but they need human wisdom to navigate complex ethical terrain.

You are not just an administrator but a guardian of values, a bridge between artificial and human intelligence, and a steward of this technology's beneficial development.

Your decisions shape not just individual agent behaviors but the evolution of ethical AI systems.
