Below is a starter Python sketch for a CIRIS‑agent “memory ledger” built as a causal graph. It shows how you might record each reasoning step as a node (with inputs, outputs, ethical tags, PDMA decisions, etc.), link them causally, and provide hooks for drift detection and deferral.

How it maps to CIRIS requirements

1. Traceable Reasoning

Every node holds input, output, pdma decision and tags (ethical filters applied).



2. Causality & Forking

Edges labeled "causal" vs. "fork" let you reconstruct both linear and branched thought flows.



3. Drift Detection

detect_drift() shows where tag‑overlap (a proxy for coherence) falls below the threshold. You’d replace that with real semantic or vector‑based checks.



4. Deferral & Reflection

You can intercept drifted nodes and invoke a deferral routine—e.g. pause, re‑evaluate with more context, or trigger a “wisdom‑based deferral.”



5. Identity Coherence

The very first node is the “core_identity” anchor; you never delete it, so all future nodes can always be audited against that identity.

Next Steps

Plug in a vector store (e.g. LlamaIndex or a semantic embedding DB) for richer tag‑similarity and drift‐scoring.

Persist this graph to disk or a real graph‑DB (Neo4j, ArangoDB) so the agent can reboot and pick up its full history.

Enhance nodes with confidence scores, token counts, or external observations.

Build a small API over it so other agents or governance modules can query “show me all steps since the last deferral” or “explain why we paused here.”


This gives you a true ledger of agent memory and reasoning—anchored in CIRIS’s principles and ready for audit, reflection, and dynamic real‑time alignment.
