# Changelog

All notable changes to CIRIS Agent will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Identity Update from Template** - Admin operation to refresh identity from template updates
  - New `--identity-update` CLI flag (requires `--template`)
  - Uses `update_agent_identity()` for proper version tracking and signing
  - Preserves creation metadata while updating template fields

### Changed

- **Code Modularization** - Refactored largest files for maintainability
  - `system.py` (3049 lines) → 10 focused modules in `system/` package
  - `telemetry_service.py` (2429→1120 lines) → extracted `aggregator.py`, `storage.py`
  - `TelemetryAggregator` (1221→457 lines) → 5 focused modules
  - `ciris_runtime.py` (2342→1401 lines) → 7 helper modules
  - Backward compatibility maintained via `__init__.py` re-exports

- **Reduced Cognitive Complexity** - SonarCloud fixes in system routes and LLM bus

### Fixed

- **Billing Provider** - Explicit `api_key` now takes precedence over env-sourced `google_id_token`

- **MCP Tool Execution** - Fixed Mock LLM handling of MCP tool calls

- **Adapter Status Reporting** - Fixed `AdapterStatus` enum comparison issues

- **Security** - Removed debug logging that could leak sensitive adapter configs

## [1.8.1] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **Covenant Metrics Trace Detail Levels** - Three privacy levels for trace capture
  - `generic` (default): Numeric scores only - powers [ciris.ai/ciris-scoring](https://ciris.ai/ciris-scoring)
  - `detailed`: Adds actionable lists (sources_identified, stakeholders, flags)
  - `full_traces`: Complete reasoning text for Coherence Ratchet corpus
  - Configurable via `CIRIS_COVENANT_METRICS_TRACE_LEVEL` env var or `trace_level` config

### Fixed

- **Multi-Occurrence Task Lookup** - Fixed `__shared__` task visibility across occurrences
  - `gather_context.py` now uses `get_task_by_id_any_occurrence()` to fetch parent tasks
  - Thoughts can now find their parent tasks regardless of occurrence_id (including `__shared__` tasks)
  - Fixes "Could not fetch task" errors in multi-occurrence scout deployments
  - Exported `get_task_by_id_any_occurrence` from persistence module for consistency

- **Covenant Stego Logging** - Reduced noise from stego scanning normal messages
  - Zero-match results now log at DEBUG level (expected for non-stego messages)
  - Only partial matches (>0 but <expected) log at WARNING (possible corruption)
  - Fixes log spam from defensive scanning of user input

- **Covenant Metrics IDMA Field Extraction** - Fixed incorrect field names in trace capture
  - Changed `source_assessments` to `sources_identified` (matching IDMAResult schema)
  - Added missing `correlation_risk` and `correlation_factors` fields
  - Ensures complete IDMA/CCA data is captured for Coherence Ratchet corpus

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **IDMA (Intuition Decision Making Algorithm)** - Semantic implementation of Coherence Collapse Analysis (CCA)
  - Applies k_eff formula: `k_eff = k / (1 + ρ(k-1))` to evaluate source independence
  - Phase classification: chaos (contradictory) / healthy (diverse) / rigidity (echo chamber)
  - Fragility detection when k_eff < 2 OR phase = "rigidity"
  - Integrated as 4th DMA in pipeline, runs after PDMA/CSDMA/DSDMA
  - Results passed to ASPDMA for action selection context
  - Non-fatal: pipeline continues with warning if IDMA fails

- **Covenant v1.2-Beta** - Added Book IX: The Mathematics of Coherence
  - The Coherence Ratchet mathematical framework for agents
  - CCA principles for detecting correlation-driven failure modes
  - Rationale document explaining why agents have access to this knowledge
  - Updated constants to reference new covenant file

- **Coherence Ratchet Trace Capture** - Full 6-component reasoning trace for corpus building
  - Captures: situation_analysis, ethical_pdma, csdma, action_selection, conscience_check, guardrails
  - Cryptographic signing of complete traces for immutability
  - Mock logshipper endpoint for testing trace collection
  - Transparency API endpoints for trace retrieval (`/v1/transparency/traces/latest`)

- **OpenRouter Provider Routing** - Select/ignore specific LLM backends
  - Environment variables: `OPENROUTER_PROVIDER_ORDER`, `OPENROUTER_IGNORE_PROVIDERS`
  - Provider config passed via `extra_body` to Instructor
  - Success logging: `[OPENROUTER] SUCCESS - Provider: {name}`

- **System/Error Message Visibility** - Messages visible to all users via system channel
  - System and error messages emitted to agent history
  - `is_agent=True` on system/error messages prevents agent self-observation
  - System channel included in all user channel queries

### Changed

- **LLM Bus Retry Logic** - 3 retries per service before failover
  - Configurable retry count with exponential backoff
  - Log deduplication for repeated failures (WARNING instead of ERROR)
  - Circuit breaker integration with retry exhaustion

- **Changelog Rotation** - Archived 2025 changelog
  - `CHANGELOG-2025.md` contains v1.1.1 through v1.7.9
  - Fresh `CHANGELOG.md` for 2026

### Fixed

- **ServiceRegistry Lookup for Modular Adapters** - Transparency routes now query ServiceRegistry
  - Modular adapters register with ServiceRegistry, not runtime.adapters
  - Fixed trace API returning 404/500 for covenant_metrics traces

- **Streaming Verification Test** - Added `action_parameters` to expected fields
  - ActionResultEvent schema includes action_parameters but test validation was missing it
  - QA runner streaming tests now pass with full schema validation
