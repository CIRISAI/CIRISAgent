- Cleaned up root directory from test artifacts
- Improved module organization and imports
- Better separation of concerns in test infrastructure

### Configuration Enhancements
- Added proxy path configuration to `APIAdapterConfig`
- Environment variable support for managed mode detection
- Improved FastAPI app initialization with proper root_path

## üìù Documentation Updates
- Added consent module documentation
- Updated QA runner README
- Improved test documentation
- Added proxy configuration guide

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
New environment variables for proxy support:
- `CIRIS_AGENT_ID` - Automatically configures proxy path as `/api/{agent_id}`
- `CIRIS_PROXY_PATH` - Explicit proxy path override
