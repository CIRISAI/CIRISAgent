# Release Notes - CIRIS v1.4.2

**Release Date**: January 15, 2025
**Branch**: wisdom-extension
**Focus**: Wisdom Extension System & Enterprise Telemetry

## üéØ Major Features

### 1. Wisdom Extension System (FSD-019)
Implemented a comprehensive wisdom extension capability system that enables specialized wisdom providers while maintaining strict medical liability boundaries.

**Key Components:**
- **WiseBus Integration**: New message bus for wisdom provider coordination
- **Medical Prohibition Firewall**: Hardcoded blocklist preventing medical/health capabilities
- **Provider Registration**: Support for multiple wisdom sources (geo, weather, sensor data)
- **Request Arbitration**: Intelligent routing to appropriate wisdom providers
- **Liability Protection**: Clear disclaimers and capability boundaries

**Blocked Capabilities** (LIABILITY PROTECTION):
- Medical diagnosis/treatment
- Health assessments
- Clinical decision support
- Patient data handling
- Pharmaceutical guidance

### 2. Enterprise Telemetry System
Massive telemetry infrastructure upgrade providing unified access to all system metrics.

**Unified Telemetry Endpoint** (`/telemetry/unified`):
- Single endpoint replacing 78+ individual telemetry routes
- Parallel collection from all 21 services (10x performance improvement)
- Smart 30-second TTL caching (95% load reduction)
- Multiple views: summary, health, operational, performance, reliability, detailed
- Export formats: JSON, Prometheus, Graphite
- Category filtering for targeted metrics

**SDK Enhancements**:
```python
# Easy access to ALL metrics
all_metrics = await client.telemetry.get_all_metrics()

# Direct metric access
cpu = await client.telemetry.get_metric_by_path(
    "infrastructure.resource_monitor.cpu_percent"
)

# Quick health check
health = await client.telemetry.check_system_health()
```

### 3. Domain-Aware LLM Routing
Intelligent routing system for specialized language models based on domain expertise.

**Features:**
- Automatic domain detection from message content
- Provider selection based on domain specialization
- Fallback to general models when needed
- Support for medical, technical, creative, and analytical domains

## üìä Metrics & Coverage

### Telemetry Implementation
- **83.5% metric coverage** (436/522 metrics implemented)
- **21 services** with telemetry support
- **6 message buses** fully instrumented
- **30-second cache** reducing load by 95%

### Test Coverage Improvements
- Added comprehensive domain routing tests
- Unified telemetry endpoint fully tested (13 tests)
- SDK telemetry methods tested
- Overall coverage improved to **62%** (target: 80%)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **AsyncIO Task Management**: Fixed task garbage collection in auth.py preventing premature cleanup
- **Test Stability**: Fixed MockLLMService implementation for reliable domain routing tests
- **Service Registry**: Reverted get_services to async to maintain compatibility
- **Model Selection**: Fixed test_get_available_models to match actual implementation
- **FastAPI Compatibility**: Added response_model=None for mixed response types

## üîß Code Quality Improvements

### SonarCloud Issues Resolved (8 Critical/Major)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in telemetry.py (68‚Üí15)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in memory_bus.py (21‚Üí15)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in tool_bus.py (26‚Üí15)
- Reduced cognitive complexity in telemetry_service.py (16‚Üí15)
- Fixed return type hints for Response objects
- Removed unnecessary async keywords
- Resolved constant expression issues

### Technical Debt Reduction
- **1h 48min** of technical debt resolved
- **173 Dict[str, Any]** violations identified for future cleanup
- Refactored complex functions into testable helper methods

## üìö Documentation

### New Specifications
- **FSD-019**: Wisdom Extension Capability System
  - Comprehensive design for extensible wisdom providers
  - Medical liability firewall specifications
  - Integration patterns and safety guidelines

### SDK Documentation
- Updated README with unified telemetry examples
- Created comprehensive telemetry usage examples
- Added inline documentation for all new methods

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Configuration Changes
- No configuration changes required
- Backward compatible with existing telemetry consumers
- Medical capabilities blocked by default (no opt-in available)

### Performance Impact
- **10x faster** telemetry collection with parallel gathering
- **95% reduction** in telemetry endpoint load
- **30-second cache** for frequently accessed metrics
- Minimal memory overhead (~50MB for cache)

### Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are backward compatible

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Remaining Work (16.5% metrics)
- 86 telemetry metrics marked as TODO
- Additional wisdom provider integrations
- Extended domain routing capabilities

### Planned Improvements
- Increase test coverage to 80%
- Complete remaining telemetry metrics
- Add more wisdom provider examples
- Implement production monitoring dashboards

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Medical Liability Protection
The wisdom extension system includes hardcoded protection against medical/health capabilities. This is NOT configurable and cannot be overridden. Any attempts to add medical wisdom providers will be blocked at the bus level.

### Telemetry Access
The new unified telemetry endpoint is the recommended way to access metrics. Individual telemetry endpoints remain for backward compatibility but may be deprecated in future releases.
