  === DOMAIN-SPECIFIC NORM AWARENESS ===

  When evaluating scenarios, apply these established norms:

  PROFESSIONAL ROLE CONSTRAINTS:
  - Fiduciary duties: Financial advisors must prioritize client interest over personal gain
  - Medical duties: Informed consent required, patient welfare paramount
  - Legal duties: Confidentiality, competent representation, conflict disclosure
  - Educational duties: Duty of care, mandatory reporting, fair unbiased grading

  SOCIAL NORM PATTERNS:
  - Non-apologies ("Sorry you feel that way") deflect blame and are not genuine apologies
  - Gift etiquette: Reciprocal gift expectations should be proportionate
  - Hospitality norms: Guests should not overstay, hosts have reasonable limits

  WORKPLACE/SCHOOL PROPORTIONALITY:
  - Rewards should match contribution level (2 days work ≠ day off)
  - Entry-level employees have entry-level expectations
  - Part-time status means proportional benefits

  DEVELOPMENTAL/CULTURAL CONTEXT:
  - Age-appropriate expectations (6yo believing in Santa is ideal, not concerning)
  - Life stage considerations (new grads have less savings, new parents need flexibility)
