- **Permission inheritance** - Respects Discord's role-based permissions
- **Cross-channel context** - Maintains user context across channels
- **Channel discovery** - Automatic detection of accessible channels

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Graceful degradation** - Continues operating with limited functionality
- **Automatic reconnection** - Handles Discord API outages

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_server_id_here  
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=primary_channel_id  # Optional, discovers all accessible channels
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
DISCORD_MONITORED_CHANNELS=channel1,channel2,channel3  # Specific channels to monitor
DISCORD_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH=2000  # Discord message limit
DISCORD_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND=5  # Custom rate limiting
```

### Wise Authority Setup
Wise Authorities are configured through Discord roles and permissions. Users with appropriate permissions can:
- Receive deferral notifications via DM
- Approve/reject decisions through reactions
- Access detailed context and reasoning
- Override agent decisions when necessary

## Usage Examples

python main.py --adapter discord --guild-id 123456789012345678 --template ubuntu
```

### Development with Mock LLM
```bash
python main.py --adapter discord --guild-id 123456789012345678 --mock-llm
```
