# Final Accurate CIRIS Metrics Count

## The Real Numbers

### Static Metrics Found in Code: ~120

### Dynamic Metrics Generated at Runtime:

#### 1. Handler Action Metrics: 33
- 10 action types × 3 states (invoked/completed/error) = 30
- Plus 3 totals (invoked_total/completed_total/error_total) = 33

The 10 action types:
- OBSERVE, SPEAK, TOOL
- REJECT, PONDER, DEFER
- MEMORIZE, RECALL, FORGET
- TASK_COMPLETE

#### 2. Service-Specific Metrics

**LLM Services** (13 metrics × ~2-3 providers = ~30):
- tokens_used, tokens_input, tokens_output
- cost_cents, carbon_grams, energy_kwh
- total_requests, failed_requests, total_latency_ms
- consecutive_failures, circuit_breaker_state
- failure_count, success_count

**Memory Service** (6 metrics):
- node_count, edge_count
- query_latency_ms, write_latency_ms
- recall_count, memorize_count

**Communication Services** (4 metrics):
- messages_processed, messages_queued
- queue_size, processing_latency_ms

**Common to ALL 23 services** (5 metrics × 23 = 115):
- availability, health_status
- uptime_seconds, error_count, request_count

**Adapter-Specific** (~11 total):
- Discord: 5 metrics
- API: 4 metrics
- CLI: 2 metrics

#### 3. Telemetry Overview Fields: 25
From SystemOverview class:
- uptime_seconds, cognitive_state
- messages_processed_24h, thoughts_processed_24h, tasks_completed_24h
- errors_24h, tokens_last_hour, cost_last_hour_cents
- carbon_last_hour_grams, energy_last_hour_kwh
- tokens_24h, cost_24h_cents, carbon_24h_grams, energy_24h_kwh
- memory_mb, cpu_percent
- healthy_services, degraded_services, error_rate_percent
- current_task, reasoning_depth
- active_deferrals, recent_incidents
- total_metrics, active_services

#### 4. Per-Service Instance Metrics
With multiple instances of services (e.g., multiple LLM providers), the actual count grows:
- 2-3 LLM providers registered
- Multiple memory backends possible
- Multiple communication adapters

## Realistic Total Estimate

### Conservative Count:
- Static metrics: 120
- Handler metrics: 33
- Service common metrics: 115 (23 services × 5)
- Service-specific: ~50
- Telemetry overview: 25
- **Total: ~343 base metrics**

### With Dynamic Instances:
- Multiple LLM providers (×2-3)
- Multiple adapters active
- Per-service-instance metrics
- **Total: 400-500 metrics**

### Production Reality (556+):
The production system reports 556+ active metrics, which makes sense when considering:
- All service instances running
- All handler actions being tracked
- Dynamic metric generation for each active component
- Runtime-generated metrics we haven't found in static analysis

## Why the Documentation Has 485 Metrics

The documentation captured a **planning view** of metrics across 35 modules, including:
- Planned metrics not yet implemented
- Conceptual metrics for future features
- Granular breakdowns of aggregate metrics
- Module-specific metrics that may not all be active

## Conclusion

✅ **The tool was initially correct about gaps**, but misunderstood the nature:
- Not 0/485 implemented
- Rather: 556+ active metrics vs 485 documented metrics
- Many active metrics are dynamically generated
- Documentation includes planned/future metrics

The real task for the MDD tool:
1. Map the 556+ active metrics to documented ones
2. Identify which documented metrics are missing
3. Prioritize implementation based on mission alignment
4. Make existing metrics queryable via individual endpoints
