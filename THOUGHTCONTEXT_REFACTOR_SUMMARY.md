# ThoughtContext Refactor Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed ThoughtContext to ThoughtState in system_context.py
- Changed class name from `ThoughtContext` to `ThoughtState`
- Updated `__all__` export to use `ThoughtState`
- This represents the state of a thought being processed

### 2. Removed alias in processing_context.py
- Removed the line `ThoughtContext = ProcessingThoughtContext`
- Updated `__all__` to only export `ProcessingThoughtContext`
- This eliminates the confusion between the two types

### 3. Updated all imports and usages
- Files importing from `system_context` now use `ThoughtState`:
  - `ciris_engine/schemas/dma/core.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/processors/support/dma_orchestrator.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/dma/pdma.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/dma/dma_executor.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/handlers/memory/forget_handler.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/handlers/control/reject_handler.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/handlers/external/observe_handler.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/handlers/external/tool_handler.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/processors/support/task_manager.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/adapters/discord/discord_observer.py`
  - `test_triaged_inputs_fix.py`

- Files importing from `processing_context` now use `ProcessingThoughtContext` directly:
  - `ciris_engine/logic/context/builder.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/adapters/discord/discord_observer.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/processors/support/processing_queue.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/processors/support/task_manager.py`
  - `ciris_engine/logic/processors/states/shutdown_processor.py`

### 4. Preserved correct imports from models.py
- Files that import `ThoughtContext` from `models.py` were left unchanged as this is the correct entity metadata class
- These include various persistence, processor, and test files

## Result
The triple definition has been resolved:
1. `ThoughtContext` in `models.py` - Entity metadata (preserved)
2. `ThoughtState` in `system_context.py` - Processing state (renamed from ThoughtContext)
3. `ProcessingThoughtContext` in `processing_context.py` - Processing context (alias removed)

This provides clear separation of concerns and eliminates naming conflicts.
