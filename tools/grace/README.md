# Grace

A sustainable development companion that helps you code for years, not sprints.

## Philosophy

Grace understands that sustainable productivity comes from working WITH your natural rhythms, not against them. It tracks your energy, preserves context across breaks, and gently reminds you of boundaries.

This is not about working more. It's about working sustainably.

## Your Schedule

Based on your actual life:
- **7-10 AM**: Morning (peak creativity)
- **10 AM**: Break for kids/life
- **12-2 PM**: Midday (good for reviews)
- **2 PM**: Nap time
- **5-7 PM**: Evening (mechanical tasks)
- **7 PM**: Family dinner/bedtime
- **10 PM-12 AM**: Night (optional deep work)

## Usage

```bash
# Quick status check
python -m grace

# Morning routine
python -m grace morning

# Before a break
python -m grace pause

# After returning
python -m grace resume

# Evening choice point
python -m grace night

# Check deployment
python -m grace deploy
```

Short forms available: s, m, p, r, n, d

## What It Tracks

- Current session and remaining time
- Hours worked today
- System health (production, CI/CD)
- Active deployments
- Git status and uncommitted changes
- Your work context across breaks

## Not What It Does

- Doesn't judge your hours
- Doesn't push notifications
- Doesn't demand compliance
- Doesn't track keystrokes
- Doesn't report to anyone

## Why This Matters

After 20 years, you learn: the coders who last are not the ones who sprint hardest. They're the ones who find a sustainable rhythm and protect it.

Grace helps you protect yours.
