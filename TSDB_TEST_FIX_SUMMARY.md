# TSDB Consolidation Test Fixes Summary

## Issue
The TSDB consolidation tests in `test_tsdb_consolidation_all_types.py` were failing due to mocking issues. The tests weren't properly mocking the `memorize` return value, causing the consolidation service to think operations were failing.

## Root Causes

1. **Case Sensitivity in Correlation Types**: The consolidation service uses lowercase correlation type strings (e.g., `"service_interaction"`), but the tests were checking for uppercase values (e.g., `"SERVICE_INTERACTION"`).

2. **Enum Value Mismatch**: The `CorrelationType` enum uses lowercase values with underscores, but the test helper function was trying to create enum instances with uppercase strings, causing `ValueError`.

3. **Missing Import**: The `base_observer.py` file was missing the `Dict` import from typing module.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Updated Mock Conditions**: Changed all test mocks to check for lowercase correlation types:
   - `"SERVICE_INTERACTION"` → `"service_interaction"`
   - `"TRACE_SPAN"` → `"trace_span"`
   - `"AUDIT_EVENT"` → `"audit_event"`

2. **Fixed Enum Mapping**: Updated the `datapoints_to_correlations` helper function to properly map uppercase tags to the correct enum values:
   ```python
   type_mapping = {
       "SERVICE_INTERACTION": CorrelationType.SERVICE_INTERACTION,
       "TRACE_SPAN": CorrelationType.TRACE_SPAN,
       "AUDIT_EVENT": CorrelationType.AUDIT_EVENT
   }
   ```

3. **Fixed Import**: Added `Dict` to the imports in `base_observer.py`.

4. **Improved Idempotency Test**: Updated the test to properly test the `_is_period_consolidated` method and handle the case where no data exists.

## Result
All 6 tests in `test_tsdb_consolidation_all_types.py` now pass successfully:
- ✅ test_end_to_end_consolidation_all_types
- ✅ test_consolidation_with_no_data
- ✅ test_consolidation_idempotency
- ✅ test_conversation_summary_preserves_full_content
- ✅ test_audit_hash_generation
- ✅ test_trace_summary_metrics

The tests now properly simulate the consolidation process and verify that summaries are created correctly for all correlation types.
