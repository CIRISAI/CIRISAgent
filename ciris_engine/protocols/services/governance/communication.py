"""Communication Service Protocol.

IMPORTANT: This is NOT one of the 21 core services!

This protocol defines the interface for adapter-provided communication services.
It is used by the CommunicationBus to enable multiple communication providers:
- CLIAdapter provides CLI-based communication
- APICommunicationService provides API-based communication
- DiscordAdapter provides Discord-based communication

There is no core CommunicationService - all communication is handled by adapters
that implement this protocol and register with the CommunicationBus.

See CLAUDE.md section on "Message Bus Architecture" for more details.
