- ✅ **Improved error handling** in moderation workflows
- ✅ **Fixed duplicated monitored channels bug** - channels no longer duplicated on config reload

### Code Quality & Technical Debt
- ✅ **Fixed service type mapping bug** where TIME matched before RUNTIME_CONTROL
- ✅ **Modernized TypeVar usage** to PEP 695 syntax (Python 3.12+)
- ✅ **Reduced cognitive complexity** in critical functions (_processing_loop: 52→8, control_runtime: 37→7)
- ✅ **Added comprehensive test coverage** for system route helper functions (48 new tests)
- ✅ **Fixed SonarCloud quality gates** - addressed duplication and complexity issues
- ✅ **Pipeline controller initialization** - always initialized, eliminating None checks
