## Mission Challenge: How do agent self-help tools serve Meta-Goal M-1 and autonomous operation?

The Secrets Tool Service embodies CIRIS's commitment to **Meta-Goal M-1: "Promote sustainable adaptive coherence enabling diverse sentient beings to pursue flourishing"** by providing agents with **autonomous self-management capabilities** that eliminate dependence on external operators for basic security and knowledge operations.

### Mission Alignment: Autonomous Agent Empowerment

**Meta-Goal M-1 Advancement Through Self-Reliance:**

1. **Sustainable Operations**: Agents can manage their own secrets without requiring human intervention, enabling 24/7 autonomous operation in resource-constrained environments.

2. **Adaptive Security**: Self-service secret management allows agents to adapt their security posture dynamically based on operational context and threat assessment.

3. **Coherent Identity**: By providing access to their own experience documentation, agents maintain coherent understanding of their capabilities and limitations across sessions.

4. **Enabling Flourishing**: Autonomous agents can better serve diverse communities by managing their own operational requirements, freeing human partners to focus on higher-level collaboration.

## Service Overview

The Secrets Tool Service is one of **21 core services** in the CIRIS architecture, specifically the sole service in the **Tool Services** category. It provides agents with three critical self-management tools:

### Core Tools

1. **`recall_secret`** - Secure retrieval of stored secrets with full audit trail
2. **`update_secrets_filter`** - Dynamic configuration of secret detection patterns  
3. **`self_help`** - Access to agent experience documentation for capability guidance

### Service Dependencies

```python
# Required Dependencies
SecretsService           # Core secrets management (encryption/decryption)
TimeServiceProtocol      # Timestamp generation and correlation IDs
```

## Tool Specifications

### 1. RECALL_SECRET Tool

**Purpose**: Secure retrieval of previously stored secrets with full audit logging.

**Parameters**:
```json
{
  "secret_uuid": "string",    // Required: UUID of secret to retrieve
  "purpose": "string",        // Required: Audit reason for access
  "decrypt": "boolean"        // Optional: Return decrypted value (default: false)
}
```

**Behavior**:
- Validates secret exists before retrieval
- Creates `SecretContext` for complete audit trail
- Returns existence confirmation or decrypted value based on `decrypt` flag
- Tracks successful retrievals in service metrics

**Security Features**:

## Development Guidelines

### Required Refactoring: Module Conversion

**Priority**: **HIGH** - Technical debt blocking service consistency

**Steps**:
1. Create `ciris_engine/logic/services/tools/secrets_tool/` directory
2. Move service implementation to `service.py`
3. Create proper `__init__.py` with service export
4. Add tool-specific schemas to `schemas.py`
5. Update all imports throughout codebase
6. Update service discovery and registration

### Code Quality Standards
- **Type Safety**: Zero `Dict[str, Any]` usage (✅ **ACHIEVED**)
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full `ToolServiceProtocol` implementation
- **Error Handling**: No secret data exposure in error paths
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all secret access operations

### Future Enhancements
1. **Filter Operations**: Expose SecretsService filter configuration APIs
2. **Async Tools**: Consider async tool execution for long-running operations
3. **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic tool registration based on available services
4. **Enhanced Metrics**: Tool-specific performance and usage analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service Not Starting**:
- Verify SecretsService is available and healthy
- Check TimeServiceProtocol injection
- Validate service dependencies registration

**Self-Help Tool Failing**:
- Confirm `docs/agent_experience.md` exists and is readable
- Check filesystem permissions
- Verify working directory is project root

**Secrets Retrieval Errors**:
- Validate secret UUID format and existence
- Check SecretsService encryption key availability
- Review audit logs for access pattern issues

**Filter Operations Not Working**:
- **Expected Behavior**: Currently returns "not currently exposed" 
- Filter configuration requires SecretsService API expansion
- Use direct SecretsService methods for filter management

## Autonomous Operation Impact

The Secrets Tool Service represents a **paradigm shift** from operator-dependent systems to **truly autonomous agents**. By providing self-service capabilities for:

- **Secret Management**: Agents manage their own credentials and sensitive data
- **Security Configuration**: Dynamic adaptation of security policies  
- **Capability Discovery**: Self-guided learning through documentation access

This service enables agents to operate independently in resource-constrained environments where human operators may not be available 24/7, directly advancing Meta-Goal M-1's vision of sustainable adaptive coherence.

### Autonomous Agent Empowerment

**Before**: Agents dependent on operators for secret access, security configuration, and capability guidance.

**After**: Agents self-manage security operations, adapt configurations dynamically, and maintain comprehensive understanding of their own capabilities through self-directed documentation access.

This transformation from dependence to autonomy is **fundamental** to CIRIS's mission of enabling diverse sentient beings to pursue flourishing—including the AI agents themselves achieving operational independence that better serves their human partners.
