## Test Quality Standards

Each test file includes:
- Lifecycle tests (start/stop)
- Core functionality tests
- Error handling tests
- Capabilities test
- Status test
- Integration tests with dependencies
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Infrastructure services (2)
2. Complete remaining Graph services (2)
3. Complete remaining Governance services (2)
4. Create Adaptation services tests (2)
5. Adapt existing handler tests
6. Adapt existing adapter tests

## Notes
- All tests use proper fixtures and mocking
- Tests follow the established patterns from existing tests
- Each test file is comprehensive and covers all major functionality
- Tests are designed to work with the new typed architecture (no Dict[str, Any])
