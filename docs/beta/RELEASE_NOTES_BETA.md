## 🔧 Installation

### Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# API mode with mock LLM
docker-compose -f docker-compose-api-mock.yml up -d

# Access at http://localhost:8080
# Default credentials: admin/ciris_admin_password
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CIRISAI/CIRISAgent.git
cd CIRISAgent

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with mock LLM
python main.py --mock-llm --adapter api
```

## 📖 Documentation

- **API Reference**: See `/docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
- **Quick Start**: See `/docs/QUICKSTART.md`
- **Architecture**: See `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **GUI**: Access at `http://localhost:3000` after starting the agent

## 🧪 Beta Testing Focus

We're particularly interested in feedback on:

1. **Performance** under resource constraints (4GB RAM target)
2. **API stability** and SDK usability
3. **Mock LLM** behavior vs real LLM integration
4. **Multi-adapter** coordination and switching
5. **Wise Authority** deferral system effectiveness

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

This is a beta release. While feature-complete, please note:

- Some telemetry metrics show placeholder values
- Real LLM integration requires API keys
- Discord adapter requires bot token configuration
- WebSocket connections may need firewall configuration

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

### Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports
- Include logs from `/app/logs/incidents_latest.log`
- Specify adapter type and configuration

## 🔐 Security

- All A-grade Sonar security assessment
- Zero security hotspots identified
- Ed25519 emergency shutdown capability
- Comprehensive audit trail

For security concerns, please email security@ciris.ai

## 📈 What's Next

### Planned for v1.0.0 (Stable)
