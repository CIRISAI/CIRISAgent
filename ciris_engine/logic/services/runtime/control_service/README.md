## Mission Statement

**Meta-Goal M-1**: *Promote sustainable adaptive coherence — the living conditions under which diverse sentient beings may pursue their own flourishing in justice and wonder.*

The Runtime Control Service serves as CIRIS's unified control plane, enabling dynamic system management, debugging, and emergency operations. It embodies Meta-Goal M-1 by ensuring the system remains adaptable, observable, and sustainably operable under diverse conditions while maintaining the coherence necessary for ethical AI operation.

## Mission Alignment: How Runtime Control Serves Meta-Goal M-1

### 🎯 Sustainable Operation Through Dynamic Control

```

### Step Point Schemas

Each pipeline step has a dedicated result schema providing comprehensive insights:

- **StepResultFinalizeTasksQueue**: Task selection criteria and metrics
- **StepResultPopulateThoughtQueue**: Thought generation from tasks
- **StepResultBuildContext**: DMA context construction
- **StepResultPerformDMAs**: Parallel DMA execution (Ethical, Common Sense, Domain)
- **StepResultPerformASPDMA**: Action Selection DMA with LLM interaction
- **StepResultConscienceExecution**: Parallel conscience evaluations
- **StepResultActionSelection**: Final action determination
- **StepResultHandlerStart**: Handler preparation and invocation
- **StepResultBusOutbound**: Message bus operations
- **StepResultPackageHandling**: Adapter-level processing
- **StepResultBusInbound**: Response aggregation
- **StepResultHandlerComplete**: Final thought completion

## Configuration Architecture

### Type-Safe Configuration Management

Following CIRIS's "No Dicts, No Strings, No Kings" philosophy:

```python
class ConfigValueMap(BaseModel):
    """Typed map for configuration values."""
    configs: Dict[str, Union[str, int, float, bool, list, dict]] = Field(
        default_factory=dict, 
        description="Configuration key-value pairs with typed values"
    )
```

### Configuration Operations

- **get_config()**: Retrieve configuration with sensitivity filtering
- **update_config()**: Hot configuration updates with validation
- **backup_config()**: Create timestamped configuration snapshots
- **restore_config()**: Rollback to previous configuration states
- **validate_config()**: Pre-deployment configuration validation

### Configuration Scopes

```python
class ConfigScope(str, Enum):
    RUNTIME = "runtime"      # Live configuration changes
    SESSION = "session"      # Session-specific overrides
    PERSISTENT = "persistent" # Permanent configuration
```

## Service Management

### Priority System Architecture

CIRIS uses a sophisticated multi-level service selection system:

#### Priority Groups
- **Group 0**: Primary services (production providers)
- **Group 1**: Secondary services (backup providers)  
- **Group 2**: Tertiary services (fallback/mock providers)

#### Priority Levels Within Groups
- **CRITICAL** (0): Highest priority within group
- **HIGH** (1): High priority services
- **NORMAL** (2): Standard priority (default)
- **LOW** (3): Low priority services
- **FALLBACK** (9): Last resort within group

#### Selection Strategies
- **FALLBACK**: First available strategy (try in priority order)
- **ROUND_ROBIN**: Load balancing (distribute across equal-priority services)

### Circuit Breaker Management

```python
class CircuitBreakerState(str, Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"      # Normal operation
    OPEN = "open"          # Service unavailable (too many failures)
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open" # Testing recovery
```

Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures by:
1. Tracking service failure rates
2. Opening circuit after threshold exceeded
3. Periodically testing service recovery
4. Closing circuit when service recovers

## Emergency Operations

### WA-Signed Emergency Shutdown

The Runtime Control Service implements cryptographically-verified emergency shutdown:

#### Signature Verification Process

```python
def _verify_wa_signature(self, command: WASignedCommand) -> bool:
    # 1. Check WA is in authorized key list
    # 2. Load Ed25519 public key from PEM format
    # 3. Reconstruct canonical signed data
    # 4. Verify Ed25519 signature
    # 5. Return verification result
```

#### Signed Data Format

```
command_id:{uuid}|command_type:emergency_shutdown|wa_id:{wa_id}|issued_at:{iso_timestamp}|reason:{reason}
```

#### Emergency Shutdown Flow

1. **Command Reception**: WA sends signed emergency command
2. **Signature Verification**: Ed25519 signature validation
3. **Authorization Check**: Verify WA is in authorized key list  
4. **Shutdown Initiation**: Trigger ShutdownService with emergency priority
5. **Status Tracking**: Record shutdown progress and completion

    adapter_type: str            # Adapter type (discord, api, cli)
    status: AdapterStatus        # Current operational status
    started_at: datetime         # Load timestamp
    messages_processed: int      # Message throughput

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Circuit Breaker Integration

```python
class CircuitBreakerStatus(BaseModel):
    state: CircuitBreakerState   # Current breaker state
    failure_count: int           # Consecutive failure count
    last_failure_time: Optional[datetime] # Most recent failure
    last_success_time: Optional[datetime] # Most recent success
    trip_threshold: int          # Failure threshold

4. **Emergency Fallback**: WA emergency shutdown as ultimate safety measure

## Development and Testing

### Service Conversion Note

**IMPORTANT**: The Runtime Control Service currently exists as a single file (`control_service.py`) but should be converted to a module structure to follow CIRIS patterns:

```
ciris_engine/logic/services/runtime/
├── control_service/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── control.py           # Main service implementation
│   ├── processor_control.py # Processor management
│   ├── adapter_management.py # Adapter lifecycle
│   ├── config_management.py # Configuration operations
│   ├── service_management.py # Service priority/circuit breakers
│   ├── health_monitoring.py # Health assessment
│   ├── emergency_ops.py     # Emergency shutdown
│   └── metrics.py          # Metrics collection
```

### Testing Strategy
