# SPEAK Handler Test Notes

## Bug Found During Testing

While writing tests for the SPEAK handler, I discovered a bug on line 67 of `/home/emoore/CIRISAgent/ciris_engine/logic/handlers/external/speak_handler.py`:

```python
if fu.context and not fu.context.channel_id:
    fu.context.channel_id = channel_id  # <-- channel_id is not defined in this scope
```

This code is in the error handling path when parameter validation fails. The variable `channel_id` is not defined at this point because it's only extracted later in the handler (line 75). This will cause an additional `NameError` if parameter validation fails.

### Suggested Fix

The channel_id should be extracted before the try block or the error handling should be updated to handle the case where channel_id is not available yet.

## Test Coverage

The comprehensive test suite covers:

1. **Message Formatting** - Tests various content types including emojis, multiline, long messages, special characters, code blocks, and empty messages
2. **Communication Bus Integration** - Verifies proper integration with the communication bus for message sending
3. **Error Handling** - Tests communication failures, missing channel IDs, parameter validation errors, and exceptions from the communication bus
4. **Channel Management** - Tests sending to different channels and channel context handling
5. **Audit Trail** - Verifies audit logging for start and completion of SPEAK actions
6. **Service Correlation** - Tests telemetry tracking through service correlations
7. **Secret Decapsulation** - Tests automatic decapsulation of secrets in message content
8. **Edge Cases** - Tests follow-up creation failures, missing tasks, and concurrent message sends
9. **Error Context Building** - Tests the helper function that builds descriptive error contexts

## Test Statistics

- Total tests: 19
- All tests passing
- Coverage includes both happy path and error scenarios
- Proper mocking of external dependencies (persistence, communication bus, services)
