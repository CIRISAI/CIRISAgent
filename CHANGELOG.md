## [1.1.1] - 2025-09-09

### Fixed
- **Emergency shutdown force termination** - Emergency shutdown endpoint now calls `emergency_shutdown()` instead of `request_shutdown()` for proper SIGKILL termination
- **ThoughtDepthGuardrail DEFER mechanism** - Fixed guardrail not returning DEFER actions to conscience, enabling proper action chain depth limiting

- **Dead code cleanup automation** - Systematic removal of unused imports, unreachable code, and unimplemented parameters via Vulture analysis
- **Enhanced test coverage** - Authentication routes coverage increased from 23.63% to 40.07% (+16.44%)
