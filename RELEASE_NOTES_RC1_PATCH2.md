# CIRIS v1.0.2-RC1 Patch 2 Release Notes

## Release Overview
This patch release includes critical bug fixes for production issues, comprehensive privacy enhancements for anonymous users, and significant test coverage improvements.

## üö® Critical Production Fixes

### FetchedMessage Instantiation Error
- **Fixed**: Production error `FetchedMessage() argument after ** must be a mapping, not FetchedMessage`
- **Impact**: Prevented new agents from fetching messages properly
- **Solution**: Made all adapters consistently return `List[FetchedMessage]` and added robust type checking in communication bus

### WA Deferrals Endpoint 500 Error
- **Fixed**: Type annotation issue causing 500 errors on `/v1/wa/deferrals` endpoint
- **Impact**: Prevented fetching deferral status via API
- **Solution**: Corrected return type annotation from `List[dict]` to proper schema type

## üîí Privacy & Security Enhancements

### Anonymous User Privacy Protection
- **New**: Comprehensive privacy utilities for anonymous users
- **Features**:
  - Content hashing for audit trail verification while preserving privacy
  - PII redaction from audit logs and telemetry for anonymous users
  - Anti-gaming measures to detect consent stream manipulation
  - Trust score preservation through anonymization
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive `ANONYMOUS_USER_HANDLING.md` guide

### Privacy Utilities (`privacy.py`)
- Sanitization functions for anonymous user data
- Redaction of emails, phone numbers, Discord mentions, URLs
- Content hash generation for future verification/refutation
- Support for consent streams: ANONYMOUS, EXPIRED, REVOKED

## üß™ Test Coverage Improvements

### New Test Suites Added
- **Privacy Utils**: 18 comprehensive tests covering all privacy functions (100% coverage)
- **Anonymous Filter**: Full test coverage for anonymous user handling in AdaptiveFilterService
- **System Snapshot**: Tests for GraphQL consent attributes, resource monitor edge cases, tool service validation
- **Base Observer**: Tests for filter error handling and task signing with WA certificates

### Improved Test Coverage Areas
- Privacy utilities: From 0% to 100%
- System snapshot corruption handling: Added edge case coverage
- Base observer filter and signing: Previously uncovered error paths now tested

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Discord Adapter
- Fixed Discord channel filtering to properly handle monitored channels
- Improved correlation creation for better message tracking
- Fixed import issues causing test failures

### System Snapshot Corruption
- Fixed and persisted corrupted `last_seen` attributes with template placeholders
- Added detection and auto-correction for placeholder values like `[INSERT_TIMESTAMP]`
- Improved corruption logging for debugging

### Code Quality
- Fixed SonarCloud code duplication issue by defining constants for redaction placeholders
- Addressed ReDoS vulnerability in email regex pattern

### Test Infrastructure
- Fixed MockConfigService missing `updated_by` parameter
- Fixed MockTimeService fixture issues
- Resolved circular import problems in tests

## üìä Statistics
- **Files Changed**: 28
- **Lines Added**: 3,068
- **Lines Removed**: 1,060
- **Test Files Added**: 5 new comprehensive test suites
- **Documentation Added**: 456 lines of privacy documentation

## üîÑ Breaking Changes
None - This is a backward-compatible patch release

## üì¶ Dependencies
No new dependencies added

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Discord Bot Configuration
If using Discord adapter, ensure:
1. Bot is invited to server using: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_ID&permissions=397552864336&scope=bot`
2. `DISCORD_SERVER_ID` environment variable matches your server ID
3. Bot has proper permissions in monitored channels

### Privacy Configuration
Anonymous user handling is automatic when consent stream is set to:
- `ANONYMOUS`
- `EXPIRED`  
- `REVOKED`
