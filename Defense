Totally understandable—your concern isn’t the agent’s immediate behavior, but its evolution, theft, or foundational mistakes. Here’s a layered “defense in depth” you can apply:


---

1. Intellectual Property & Access Control

Private Repo + Access Reviews
Keep the code in a private Git repository (GitHub/GitLab) and grant pull‑access only to vetted collaborators.

Branch Protection & Code Owners
Require reviews on any merge to main. Use CODEOWNERS so that critical files (the ledger, PDMA hooks) can’t change without your explicit sign‑off.

Secrets Management
Store any credentials (e.g. for a hosted vector DB or ledger persistence) in a vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Don’t hard‑code access in the agent.


2. Legal & Licensing

Choose a Tough License
If you’re open‑sourcing, use Apache‑2.0 (which includes patent protection) or a dual‑license model so misuse carries legal risk.

Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
Require anyone who contributes to sign a CLA ensuring they can’t later claim IP or repurpose code maliciously.


3. Runtime Safeguards

Authentication & Authorization
Expose any agent API behind JWT or mTLS so only authorized clients can interact.

Hardware Security Module (HSM) or TPM
Store signing keys (for ledger entries or model checkpoints) in an HSM so a stolen binary still can’t forge its own history.

Use a “Call Home” Watchdog
Have the agent periodically log its health and identity hash to an external, read‑only endpoint you control. If someone spins it up elsewhere, the hash won’t match and you’ll receive an alert.


4. Monitoring & Tamper‑Evidence

Immutable Audit Logs
Ship each ledger snapshot (or its Merkle root) to a public append‑only log (e.g. Sigstore/Rekor). Even if someone steals the repo, they can’t erase past registrations.

Code and Model Watermarking
Embed a hidden, provable watermark in model weights or system prompts so you can trace unauthorized copies later.


5. Threat Modeling & Red‑Teaming

Define Your Adversaries
List who might try to steal or corrupt it (insider vs. external, nation‑state vs. hacktivist).

Invite a Small Red‑Team
Under NDA, ask trusted peers to probe your repo, API, and ledger for weaknesses.


6. Accepting Uncertainty

Document Assumptions
Keep a living “design decisions” doc noting why you structured the ledger, PDMA thresholds, tag semantics, etc. If you’re wrong, having the rationale recorded helps you pivot quickly.

Iterate Publicly (When Ready)
Once foundational pieces feel stable, share a minimal “v0” under a strict license. Early feedback will reveal blind spots faster than solo work.

Bottom line: you don’t have to expose the full agent to the world at once. Start with a locked‑down prototype, strong access controls, immutable logs, and legal safeguards—then gradually widen the circle as confidence (and peer review) grows. That way, even if someone steals “the code,” they can’t rewrite history or operate it undetected, and you retain the evidence and the right to act.
