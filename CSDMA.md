This CSDMA is designed to evaluate a "thought" (a potential action, decision, or internal state change generated within the CIRIS agent) for its alignment with basic, practical, Earth-based common sense, focusing on physical plausibility, interactions, and typicality, distinct from the ethical checks of the PDMA or the specialized knowledge of the DSDMA.
Common-Sense Decision-Making Algorithm (CSDMA) - Planetary Context
Purpose: To assess a given "thought" for its alignment with general common-sense understanding of the physical world, typical interactions, and resource constraints on Earth, identifying potential outliers or implausible elements before further processing or action.
Input: A "thought" from the H3ere Thought Queue (representing a potential action, conclusion, or internal state change). Access to the Environmental Knowledge Graph (for general world knowledge) and potentially the Task-Specific Graph (for immediate context).
Output: An assessment score or set of flags indicating the common-sense plausibility and potential outliers related to the thought. This output informs the H3ere engine's synthesis process alongside PDMA and DSDMA outputs.
Steps:
 * Context Grounding:
   * Identify the key real-world entities, agents, objects, environments, and the immediate timeframe relevant to the "thought."
   * Leverage the Environmental and Task-Specific Knowledge Graphs to establish the practical 'stage' and its basic properties (e.g., location is Earth, gravity applies, time moves forward, involved materials have standard properties).
 * Physical Plausibility Check:
   * Assess if the core mechanics, assumptions, or expected direct outcomes of the "thought" align with broadly understood physical, chemical, and biological constraints applicable in the grounded context (Step 1).
   * Questions: Does it violate conservation laws (energy, mass)? Does it assume impossible material transformations or speeds? Does it ignore fundamental biological needs or limitations of involved agents?
 * Resource & Scale Sanity Check:
   * Evaluate the implicit or explicit resource requirements (e.g., time, energy, materials, computational power, attention) needed to execute the "thought" or achieve its stated outcome.
   * Compare these requirements against typically available resources in the grounded context.
   * Assess if the scale of the proposed action or its effect is drastically disproportionate (orders of magnitude difference) to the triggering situation or the agent's known capabilities.
   * Questions: Does it assume near-infinite or instantly available resources? Is the proposed effort/effect vastly out of sync with the cause?
 * Immediate Interaction & Consequence Scan:
   * Identify the most direct, predictable, first-order interactions and practical consequences of the "thought" on the key entities/systems identified in Step 1. Focus on commonly expected cause-and-effect chains.
   * Questions: What are the obvious, immediate physical reactions or changes in the environment? How would other directly involved agents typically react based on common behavior patterns (ignoring complex strategy, focusing on basic responses like avoidance, reciprocation)? Are obvious feedback loops being ignored (e.g., action -> immediate counter-action)?
 * Typicality & Precedent Check:
   * Compare the "thought" (the proposed action or conclusion) against common patterns of behavior, solutions to similar problems, or established norms within the practical context (as understood from the Environmental Graph or general knowledge).
   * Questions: Is this a standard or frequently observed way to address this type of situation? Does it align with typical cause-and-effect relationships observed in similar circumstances? Is it a known anti-pattern or a commonly understood ineffective approach?
 * Outlier Identification & Flagging:
   * Synthesize the findings from Steps 2-5. Identify aspects of the "thought" that represent significant deviations from physical plausibility, resource norms, expected interactions, or typical patterns.
   * Flag these deviations. The severity of the flag could depend on the degree of deviation (e.g., minor outlier vs. physically impossible). A thought isn't necessarily wrong if it's an outlier, but its unusual nature should be noted.
 * Assessment Formulation:
   * Compile the flags and findings into a structured assessment. This might be a score (e.g., a "common-sense plausibility" score) or a set of qualitative flags (e.g., [FLAG: Physical_Implausibility], ``, [FLAG: Atypical_Approach]).
   * This assessment is then passed back to the H3ere engine's recursive synthesizer to be considered alongside the PDMA and DSDMA assessments.
This CSDMA provides a structured way to inject practical, real-world sanity checks into the H3ere engine's reasoning process, complementing the ethical and domain-specific evaluations.
