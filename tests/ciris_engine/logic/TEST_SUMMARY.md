# Service Tests Summary

## Overall Status
- **Total Tests Created**: 51  
- **Passing**: 50 (98%)
- **Skipped**: 1 (2%)
- **Failing**: 0

## Detailed Results by Service Category

### ✅ Lifecycle Services (27/27 tests passing)
1. **Time Service** (8 tests) - ALL PASSING
   - Lifecycle, time operations, consistency, mocking support
   
2. **Shutdown Service** (9 tests) - ALL PASSING
   - Lifecycle, shutdown requests, handlers, thread safety
   
3. **Initialization Service** (10 tests) - ALL PASSING  
   - Lifecycle, phase execution, verification, timeouts

### ✅ Runtime Services (23/24 tests passing, 1 skipped)
1. **LLM Service** (10/10 tests passing)
   - ✅ Lifecycle, structured calls, retry logic, error handling
   - ✅ FIXED: capabilities test (changed to use 'actions' field)
   - ✅ FIXED: status test (use numeric metrics only)
   
2. **Secrets Service** (13/14 tests passing, 1 skipped)
   - ✅ Lifecycle, store/retrieve, filtering, metadata tracking
   - ⏭️ SKIPPED: update_secret (not supported by design - security feature)
   - ✅ FIXED: reencrypt_all (added method to SecretsService)

## Key Fixes Applied

### API Alignment
- Updated all test method calls to match actual service APIs
- Fixed schema field names and types
- Handled tuple returns from LLM service
- Adapted to actual SecretsService methods (process_incoming_text, recall_secret, etc.)

### Schema Updates  
- Fixed ActionSelectionDMAResult field names
- Updated ServiceCapabilities/ServiceStatus field expectations
- Removed references to non-existent schemas (SecretMetadata)

### Mock Improvements
- Added proper __name__ attributes to mock handlers
- Fixed AsyncOpenAI client mocking
- Handled proper exception constructors (APIConnectionError)

## Fixes Applied in This Session
1. **LLM Service**: Fixed ServiceCapabilities to use 'actions' field instead of 'capabilities'
2. **LLM Service**: Fixed ServiceStatus to use numeric metrics and correct fields
3. **SecretsService**: Added reencrypt_all method for key rotation support
4. **Tests**: Only 1 test remains skipped (update_secret - intentionally not supported)

## Next Steps
- Fix import errors in remaining test files (graph, governance, infrastructure)
- Create tests for remaining services (6 more to go)
- Adapt existing handler and adapter tests
