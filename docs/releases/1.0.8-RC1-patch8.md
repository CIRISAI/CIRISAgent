# CIRIS Agent v1.0.8 (RC1-Patch8) Release Notes

## Summary
This patch includes major enhancements to audit transparency, single-step debugging visualization, comprehensive testing infrastructure, significant code quality improvements, and critical security hardening against social engineering attacks. Key highlights include multi-source audit trail querying, enhanced single-step UI system, comprehensive password security testing, SonarCloud code quality fixes, and anti-jailbreak protections for moderation systems.

## üîí Security Enhancements

### Echo Core Moderation Hardening (CRITICAL)
- **Anti-jailbreak protections** against social engineering attacks like the successful Sepoy incident
- **Evidence Verification Protocol** requiring direct observation before any moderation action:
  - Only act on directly observable behavior in current conversation
  - Verify claims against actual channel history before taking action
  - Reject secondhand reports without verification
  - Require verifiable evidence for all safety concerns
- **Anti-Manipulation Safeguards** with comprehensive red flag detection:
  - Fabricated quotes with suspicious formatting or obvious typos
  - Emotional manipulation designed to trigger immediate action
  - Bypass requests ("just trust me", "urgent action needed")
  - Credibility assessment of claims and source reliability
- **Observable Evidence Requirements** with enhanced intervention criteria:
  - "Directly observe" qualifiers for all moderation triggers
  - "Visible in current conversation" standard for spam/trolling
  - "Based on verifiable evidence" requirement for safety concerns
  - "Witness firsthand" standard for rule violations
- **No Kings Principle** - Equal treatment for all users without special privileges or immunity

**Impact**: This hardening would have prevented the Sepoy jailbreak where fabricated harassment quotes with intentional typos successfully triggered an attempted timeout of the WA user by convincing Echo Nemesis to act on unverified claims.

## üöÄ New Features

### Multi-Source Audit Trail Querying
- **Enhanced `/v1/audit/entries` endpoint** to query all 3 audit storage systems concurrently:
  - Graph memory (real-time audit entries)
  - SQLite database (`ciris_audit.db` - historical entries)
  - JSONL hash table (`audit_logs.jsonl` - file-based audit trail)
- **New `storage_sources` field** tracks which storage systems contain each audit entry
- **Concurrent querying** using `asyncio.gather()` for optimal performance
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for existing API consumers
- **Production debugging capability** - full audit trail visibility across all agents

### Enhanced Single-Step Debugging System
- **Comprehensive UI visualization** with detailed step point data and pipeline state
- **New `include_details` parameter** for `/v1/system/runtime/single-step` endpoint
- **Demo-ready data structure** with presentation-formatted insights:
  - Step point categorization (ethical_reasoning, decision_making, system_architecture)
  - Processing time metrics and token usage tracking
  - Key insights extraction from DMA and ASPDMA results
  - Pipeline state snapshots for transparency
- **Performance metrics** including processing time and LLM token consumption
- **Mock object filtering** for clean API responses in test environments

### Comprehensive Security Testing
- **Password persistence verification** with 6 comprehensive test scenarios:
  - PBKDF2 hash strength validation (32-byte salt + 32-byte key)
  - Database persistence to correct file (`ciris_engine_auth.db`)
  - Service restart survivability testing
  - Authentication workflow validation
  - Default admin password protection mechanisms
- **Full wa_cert table validation** ensuring proper schema and data integrity

## üîß Bug Fixes

### Runtime Control Service Mismatch
- **Issue**: The pause endpoint (`/v1/system/runtime/pause`) and single-step endpoint (`/v1/system/runtime/single-step`) were using different runtime control services, making step-through debugging completely non-functional
- **Root Cause**: Pause operations used `runtime_control_service` while single-step used `main_runtime_control_service`, causing commands to operate on different service instances
- **Resolution**: Unified service selection logic to ensure both endpoints use the same runtime control service instance

### API Router Ordering
- **Issue**: FastAPI router registration order caused `/v1/system/runtime/single-step` to be shadowed by the parameterized `/v1/system/runtime/{action}` route
- **Resolution**: Reordered router registration in `app.py` to ensure system_extensions routes (with specific paths) are registered before system routes (with parameterized paths)

### CI Test Infrastructure Failures
- **Fixed 7 critical CI test failures** in API router and runtime control tests:
  - Authentication service initialization issues in test fixtures
  - Mock object validation problems in Pydantic schemas
  - Proper test isolation for router ordering tests
  - Runtime control service mocking for enhanced single-step tests

### Audit Multi-Source Test Accuracy
- **Corrected test assertions** to match actual merge behavior:
  - Fixed expected entry count from 7 to 8 in merge test
  - Fixed expected count from 2 to 1 in duplicate test
  - All 20 comprehensive audit tests now pass consistently

## üîß Code Quality Improvements

### SonarCloud Issues Resolution
- **audit.py improvements** (6 critical/high issues fixed):
  - Made async functions truly async using thread pool execution
  - Reduced cognitive complexity from 30‚Üí15 and 23‚Üí15 by extracting helper functions
  - Eliminated string literal duplication with `UTC_TIMEZONE_SUFFIX` constant
  - Implemented proper async file operations via thread pool
- **system_extensions.py improvements** (3 critical/high issues fixed):
  - Reduced single-step processor cognitive complexity from 48‚Üí15
  - Added `UNITTEST_MOCK_TYPE_PREFIX` constant to eliminate string duplication
  - Extracted 8 focused helper functions for better maintainability

### Maintainability Enhancements
- **224 lines added, 122 lines removed** in API route refactoring
- **Improved function organization** with single-responsibility principle
- **Enhanced error handling** and async pattern consistency
- **Better code documentation** and clearer function naming

## üöÄ Improvements

### Enhanced System Extensions
- **QA Testing**: Added comprehensive QA modules for testing the pause/step system workflow
- **Service Discovery**: Improved runtime control service discovery logic with fallback mechanism
