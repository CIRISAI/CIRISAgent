This module contains the ThoughtProcessor class organized into focused phase files:
- main.py: Core orchestration and coordination
- gather_context.py: Context building phase
- perform_dmas.py: Multi-perspective analysis phase  
- perform_aspdma.py: Action selection phase
- conscience_execution.py: Ethical validation phase
