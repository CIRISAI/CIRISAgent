CIRIS Telemetry Tool - Mission-Driven Development Assistant

A tool that ensures every telemetry endpoint serves adaptive coherence (M-1),
not just operational metrics. This implements Mission-Driven Development (MDD)
where every API endpoint must advance the flourishing of sentient beings.

Core Philosophy:
- Every metric must be auditable and transparent
- Every data flow must respect autonomy and dignity
- Every endpoint must serve beneficence and avoid maleficence
- Everything aligns with Meta-Goal M-1: Adaptive Coherence

The Three-Legged Stool:
1. Protocol (Contract) - The promise of what will be done
2. Schema (Type Safety) - The shape of data that flows
3. Module (Implementation) - The actual work being done
Seat: Mission (Adaptive Coherence) - Why we're doing it
