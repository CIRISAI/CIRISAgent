# Startup Issues Fixed Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the CIRIS Agent startup issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Identity Storage Issue ✅
**Problem**: "Identity node exists but contains no identity data. Database corruption detected."
**Root Cause**: Identity data was being stored as a generic GraphNode without proper serialization of the complex AgentIdentityRoot object.
**Fix**: Created IdentityNode class extending TypedGraphNode with proper serialization/deserialization methods.
**Files Modified**:
- `/ciris_engine/schemas/services/nodes.py` - Added IdentityNode class
- `/ciris_engine/logic/persistence/models/identity.py` - Updated storage/retrieval to use IdentityNode

### 2. TimeService Not in Registry ✅
**Problem**: "TimeService not found in registry"
**Root Cause**: TimeService was initialized but never registered in ServiceRegistry.
**Fix**: Added TimeService registration after initialization.
**Files Modified**:
- `/ciris_engine/logic/runtime/service_initializer.py` - Added registration call

### 3. TimeService Method Error ✅
**Problem**: "'TimeService' object has no attribute 'get_current_time'"
**Root Cause**: Code was calling non-existent method get_current_time() instead of now().
**Fix**: Changed method call to use correct now() method.
**Files Modified**:
- `/ciris_engine/logic/processors/states/wakeup_processor.py` - Fixed method call

### 4. Async/Await Warning ✅
**Problem**: "coroutine 'ShutdownService.request_shutdown' was never awaited"
**Root Cause**: Calling async method from sync context without proper handling.
**Fix**: Used sync wrapper function request_global_shutdown instead.
**Files Modified**:
- `/ciris_engine/logic/runtime/ciris_runtime.py` - Use sync shutdown wrapper

### 5. SQLite Threading Issue ✅
**Problem**: "SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread"
**Root Cause**: SQLite connections were not configured for multi-threaded access.
**Fix**: Added check_same_thread=False to all SQLite connections.
**Files Modified**:
- `/ciris_engine/logic/persistence/db/core.py` - Added parameter to connection
- `/ciris_engine/logic/services/graph/audit_service.py` - Updated all connections

### 6. Service Shutdown Order ✅
**Problem**: "No memory service available for telemetry_service" during shutdown
**Root Cause**: Services were being stopped in wrong order - memory service stopped before dependent services.
**Fix**: Reorganized shutdown sequence to stop services in reverse dependency order.
**Files Modified**:
- `/ciris_engine/logic/runtime/ciris_runtime.py` - Reordered service shutdown

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created at `/tests/test_startup_issues_fixed.py` that verifies:
- Runtime initialization completes successfully
- All critical services are initialized
- TimeService is properly registered and functional
- Identity is stored and retrieved correctly
- Shutdown sequence completes without errors

## How to Verify

1. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_startup_issues_fixed.py
   ```

2. Or run main.py with a fresh database:
   ```bash
   rm -rf data/
   python main.py --adapter api --template datum --mock-llm --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```

The agent should now start up successfully and reach the WAKEUP state without any of the previous errors.
