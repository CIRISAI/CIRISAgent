# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by newer versions.

## Archived Documents

### QUICK_START_PYTHON_CLI.md
- **Original name**: QUICK_START.md
- **Archived**: July 27, 2025
- **Reason**: Superseded by QUICKSTART.md which focuses on Docker-based deployment
- **Content**: Python CLI-focused quick start guide
- **Note**: The Python CLI approach is still valid but Docker is now the recommended method

## Why Archive?

Documents are archived rather than deleted to:
1. Preserve historical context
2. Support users on older versions
3. Maintain alternative approaches
4. Document the evolution of the project

## Using Archived Documentation

While these documents are no longer the primary reference, they may still be useful for:
- Understanding legacy setups
- Supporting existing Python-based deployments
- Historical reference
